32476,Militarized Police Raid Peaceful Standing Rock Protest to Enforce Corporate Dream,"Waking Times 
Today, the government has returned in force, in multiple busses brimming with militarized police and tactical weaponry, all for some peaceful non-violent protesters. Arrests have already begun at the “front-line camp,” a no-fly zone has been instituted, and cell and internet coverage have been shut-down; all the more reason to question the legitimacy of this pipeline and the people from whom the land is being taken , as clearly the desire is to have as little coverage of this as possible. 
Ask yourself why, despite the national outcry against the DAPL and others like it, and virtually zero support save for corporate and governmental entities, the US government is unfaltering in its push to accomplish this environmentally damaging, unconstitutional defiling of land that will put to risk, not only multiple states’ well-being, but desecrate sacred Native-American land. It’s not enough that this entire nation is built on the robbery of land from an entire race of people, but it appears the government has returned to finish the job. 
Now this may seem sensationalist to many, but for those who have been following the story in North Dakota, the level of totalitarian police state control that is being witnessed is staggering. From stars such as Shailene Woodley being singled out from thousands involved and arrested for simply participating in a peaceful protest(as if to make a clear point to other famous Americans with a conscious), to children and senior citizens getting attacked and treated like criminals for attempting to stand, in a non-violent fashion, and fight for their rights as Americans; the original ones at that. Journalists are even getting arrested and charged just for trying to cover this extremely relevant story . 
After being outlasted and outmanned, the government had recently chosen to leave the scene, claiming a lack of man-power to remove the protesters. This left many to hope that they might have come to their senses and realized that this level of resistance and this type of national story wasn’t worth it; or that the government realized that they should be fulfilling the will of the people and not fighting for some faceless corporate entity … but those wishful thinkers clearly didn’t realize how dedicated the US government is to maintaining its symbiotic relationship with its corporate sponsors , and its unwavering ability to disregard the Constitution when it suits their needs. 
Aside from the obvious constitutional violations, one must consider that the leaking and spilling of these pipelines in the surrounding areas, is a common occurrence . If recent years have shown us anything, it’s that environmental catastrophes such as these are the rule, not the exception. It has become so common place that these corporate giants can devastate the Amazon with a massive oil spill , and it does not even make the evening news . 
What many don’t know, is that the clean-up associated with a spill from one of these pipelines, or from a tanker for instance, is massive business, and creates millions in profit for those involved . Connections between the oil companies and the groups hired to conduct the oil clean-up are quite apparent, but with the infectious nature of corporate influence today, these companies no doubt have clear connections with just about every one of relevance. That being said, the mutually beneficial partnership that exists in this dynamic is nonetheless alarming. BP makes enough in under a week to cover much of the costs that go along with such an intensive clean up. In an article by Think Progress , they outline this absurdity following the Gulf spill : 
For now, at least, BP’s prodigious costs combating the oil spill in the Gulf are outweighed by prodigious profits. 
On Monday , BP said it spent $350 million in the first 20 days of the spill response, about $17.5 million a day. It has paid 295 of the 4,700 claims received, for a total of $3.5 million. By contrast, in the first quarter of the year, the London-based oil giant’s profits averaged $93 million a day. 
The amount of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico has been estimated at 5,000 to 25,000 barrels a day. In the first quarter, BP produced 2.5 million barrels of crude oil a day worldwide — and it received $71.86 for every barrel. 
When confronted with the astounding level of profit that these oil companies make in a given day, it is very clear that, to them, the losses taken were inconsequential, which gives them all the more motivation to play it fast and loose next time around. It is also clear that they make enough money to spend more to ensure this simply no longer happens if they truly wanted to, yet, they instead choose to play chicken with the world’s ecosystem, as the US government seems to have no problem turning a blind eye when it pertains to any such industry. 
The continual profit being made by cutting corners and forgoing precautions, due to their lack of concern of actually being held accountable, surpasses the minuscule cost to them of hiring their clean-up company, from which they no doubt receive some sort of kickback and most likely have on speed dial. “At $93 million a day in profits, BP makes $350 million in about 3.8 days. The Washington Post noted that Exxon, through a decision by the Supreme Court, was able to pay only $507.5 million of the original $5 billion in punitive damages that it had been assessed for the 1989 Valdez disaster.” So even when being “held accountable,” if you can call it that, these monolithic companies get let off with a proverbial “slap on the wrist” when considering the amount of profit they generate in a given year. 
Some would even go as far as to make the claim that companies will intentionally create circumstances that make these type of disasters more of a possibility, just to create an artificial demand, hire their go-to clean-up company, and start the process all over again. And many are unaware that deliberate discharges from oil tankers have traditionally been the biggest source of oil pollution from ships, greater than the accidental spills by far, and they are common-practice. So either way, this entire industry is one big environmental disaster that continues to grow with dependence upon it. 
These pipelines, such as the one being forced upon the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota, are put in as quickly as possible by the lowest bidder with little to no concern for the preservation of the local lands. The only motivation given to the locals, if any, is that there will be an increase in jobs from the pipeline(while being built), but that is hardly worth the environmental destabilization of ones homeland. This does not even take into consideration the detrimental effects of the drilling and construction work alone, but that aside, one single leak can cause generations of problems, that in many cases will never be recovered, such as an endangered species . Yet sadly, this country has all but forgotten about the damaging effects its industry can have on our co-inhabitants of this planet. 
As this atrocity continues in the face of public resistance and nationwide protest, ask yourself if this feels like the democracy politicians so fervently claim we have (even though it should be a republic), or the freedom we are continually told the world begrudges us. Ask yourself if the will of the people ever truly dictates the path of the United States, or if that is simply what we are told. About the Author

18997,"EPA says website undergoing makeover to match Trump, Pruitt views","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The website of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.gov, is getting a makeover to reflect the views of President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, the agency said on Friday. “As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air, land and water, our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency,” it said in a statement. Trump, a climate change doubter, campaigned on a pledge to boost the U.S. oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries by slashing regulation. He also promised to pull Washington out of a global pact to fight climate change. The first page to be updated is one that reflects Trump’s executive order on energy independence, which calls for a review of the Clean Power Plan put into place by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, the statement said. “Language associated with the Clean Power Plan, written by the last administration, is out of date,” it said. “Similarly, content related to climate and regulation is also being reviewed.” The Clean Power Plan aimed to sharply reduce carbon dioxide emissions from electrical power generation over 25 years, focusing on reductions from coal-burning power plants and increasing the use of renewable energy and energy conservation. “We want to eliminate confusion by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how we’re protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law,” J.P. Freire, associate administrator for public affairs at the agency, said in the statement. The website changes will comply with agency ethics and legal guidance, including proper archiving, so a snapshot of the Obama administration’s website would remain available from the main page, the statement said. In January, EPA sources told Reuters that administration officials had asked the agency to take down the climate change page on its website, and that EPA staff had pushed back in an effort to convince the administration to preserve it. [L1N1FF00N] The page includes links to scientific research, emissions data from industrial plants and a multi-agency report that describes trends related to the causes and effects of climate change. Pruitt led 14 lawsuits against the agency when he was Oklahoma’s attorney general. Last month he said he was not convinced that carbon dioxide from human activity is the main driver of climate change, a position widely embraced by scientists.

65277,WAS MICHELLE OBAMA In On Beyonce’s Cop-Hating Super Bowl Performance? [Video],"In an interview that is a tradition before the Super Bowl, the Obamas sat down with Oprah s BFF Gayle King to chitty chat about trivial things. Injecting politicians into the Super Bowl festivities has become more and more a normality. The Obamas have taken it to an all new level. It s to be expected but the real concern today is the question of whether Michelle Obama tipped her hat to the fact that she was in on the anti-American, cop-hating half-time performance by Beyonce. You be the judge:Michelle Obama s pre-game Super Bowl fluff interview revealed that she  cared deeply about the halftime show,  even coordinating her outfit for Beyonce s approval.President and Mrs. Obama sat down Sunday with  CBS This Morning  anchor Gayle King, a family friend, for what has become a tradition   a pre-Super Bowl interview.Sunday s performance was a far cry from the contentious exchange that occurred two years earlier with Fox News host Bill O Reilly. In fact, it was nothing short of a love fest that threatened to ruin the day for serious sports fans.Joined by the first lady for the first time, it was a given that the Obamas complained   about such things like bad Wi-Fi service at the White House   before discussing first dates and post-presidency plans, among other hard-hitting topics.The first lady said she cared  deeply about the halftime game show,  likely because pal Beyonc , one of this year s halftime performers, was planning to get political in support of Black Lives Matter. I got dressed for the halftime show,  Michelle said.  I hope Beyonc  likes what I ve got on. Mrs. Obama was dressed in all black, we assume in simpatico with the artist s dancers who performed in wardrobes that resembled the Black Panthers. The only thing missing was a Black Panther beret. Furious Americans are expressing their disappointment and outrage that the Super Bowl halftime show was allowed to be hijacked for political purposes and given a racist, black power theme.Read more: Biz Pac Review",1

41762,John Bolton: Moving U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem as Simple as Moving the Sign from One Building to Another,"Former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday’s edition of Breitbart News Daily to discuss the prospective relocation of America’s Israel embassy to Jerusalem. [Bolton said he was “concerned that the pace appears to have slowed down” on the subject of moving America’s embassy to Jerusalem.   LISTEN: “I think one of the things that distinguished Donald Trump, and you can see it even in his first days in office, is during the campaign he said ‘I’m going to do X, Y, and Z’  —   and miraculous to behold, he’s actually doing it on so many different fronts, internationally and domestically,” he said.  “The kind of exception, at this point, appears to be moving the embassy. As I think we’ve commented before, you can move the embassy by taking the plaque off the wall at our consulate building in Jerusalem and putting up a sign that says ‘U. S. Embassy.’ You can build a bigger embassy, the   embassy, obviously over a longer period of time, but you could make the dramatic move quickly,” Bolton argued. “I very much fear that what’s happening is that foreign countries, the State Department, maybe some inside the administration are saying, ‘Oh, but it’s going to cause difficulties. People are threatening to riot. It’ll hurt the interests of Israel and the United States,’ and this and that and the other thing, which is what they say every time this issue comes up,” he said.  “But once you slow down, once you miss the chance to strike dramatically in the early days  —   and there’s a diplomatic phrase for that, of course, in French we say ‘making it a fait accompli,’ an accomplished fact  —   once you give up that opportunity, the cost actually mounts. And so we’ll see what happens. We’ll know more, I think, when Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel comes in the next few weeks, and see what he and the President discuss,” Bolton anticipated. He allowed that moving the embassy “would certainly necessitate a lot of active diplomacy to calm down people who might be concerned about it,” but said reneging on Trump’s stated commitment to the move would be tantamount to “allowing other people, in other countries, to tell us who we talk to, where we put our embassy. ” For that reason, Bolton thought Trump did a “fantastic thing when he took a congratulatory phone call from Tsai   the president of Taiwan”  —   an unprecedented move that caused “a lot of heart murmurings in some quarters, and upset Beijing, heaven forbid. ” “Here is a case where the United States, for years, has let Beijing tell us who we could talk to in Taiwan. Just think about that for a minute. And now we have other governments telling us where we can put our embassy in Israel. Can they tell us where to put our embassy in Canada?” he asked sarcastically. “I’m not talking about relations with Canada or Israel. I’m talking about Germany saying, ‘Well, you can’t put your embassy in Canada there. ’”  “Obviously the Middle East is a sensitive area,” he conceded. “You want to be prudent, you want to be careful. But you ought to do what the United States needs to have done. The qualms that others may have are things you need to alleviate, you need to deal with, you need to be reasonable about it, but they’re not qualms that stop you from acting in your own interest. ” Bolton said it was “absolutely” a good thing that Israel has been “emboldened” to build more settlements by Trump’s election. “There’s a huge legal battle over what the status of the   occupied territories is, going back to the League of Nations mandate, and the assumption of the mandate by the United Nations in 1945, and the termination of the mandate in Israel’s declaration of independence in 1948,” he recalled.  “I mean, we could spend hours going through this. Here’s the reality: the U. N. in 1967 basically said, after the   War, Israel can trade land for peace. Up until the resolution Obama allowed to go through, two days before Christmas, that was the basis for peace in the Middle East. That was the basis for Israel’s peace treaty with Egypt, for its treaty with Jordan. It could have been the basis of peace with others. ”  “Israel has the land. Let’s forget the legalities. Israel has control of the territory. They believe it’s their land, dating back historically, and they’re building settlements on it. I tell you what, nobody’s going to stop them,” Bolton declared.  “You can either deal with that reality and look for what a solution for the Palestinians would be  —   I don’t think it’s the   solution, I think it’s giving parts of the West Bank to Jordan, putting it under their sovereignty, Israel keeping the rest. Or you can just enjoy the rhetoric about how settlements are an obstacle to peace, and it’s really terrible, and so on and so forth. It’s the same sort of threatening rhetoric that accompanies talk about whether the U. S. will move its embassy to Jerusalem,” he said. “So I think the real answer, I think the Israelis know what they’re doing. I think they’re going to create their own facts on the ground, which is what the United States ought to do with the embassy,” he suggested. Marlow turned to President Trump’s executive orders restricting immigration from several   countries, orders which are certain to stir up controversy. Bolton noted those countries were also places where “we can have little or no faith in the sustained ability of the   governments of these countries to be able to tell us honestly the backgrounds of a lot of people who are applying for visas. ” “There is no effective government in Yemen now, for example, just to name one. Or Syria, while we’re on the subject,” Bolton said. “It’s a temporary ban. I think Trump during the campaign, although he made sweeping statements earlier, came back by the end of the campaign to a program very similar to what Ted Cruz articulated, very similar to what the George W. Bush administration put in place after  : that you’re concerned more about applicants for visas from countries that are sources of terrorism than you’re concerned about applicants for visas from countries that are not sources of terrorism. ”  “I would be more concerned across the board about somebody from Syria applying for a visa than I am about somebody from Iceland applying for a visa,” he said. “This is not hard to figure out. It doesn’t have anything to do with religion. It has to do with terrorism. ” “So getting the system under control  —   and I think law enforcement and intelligence officials, even in the Obama administration, testified that we didn’t have adequate vetting for visa applicants  —   is sensible. It’s what Trump said he was going to do. Nobody should be surprised at this,” Bolton concluded. Commenting on the recent court setback for Brexit, Bolton said he didn’t think the ruling was “quite as bad as it could have been,” and doubted it would be a serious impediment to British Prime Minister Theresa May “negotiating Brexit on her terms. ” “Some of the things they didn’t do in the court ruling are important,” he noted. “Number One, there’s no reference in this issue to the European High Court, the highest judicial body of the European Union, which could have been fatal. Given the way   have been subordinated to the European Union, that was not entirely out of the question. So that’s one big win there. ” “Second, none of the   devolved parliaments  —   whether in Ireland, Wales, or Scotland  —   are going to have any say in it,” he continued. “The court ruled this is a national matter for the United Kingdom as a whole, and that’s great. So Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish National Party can go pound sand on this one. It’s going to be decided in Westminster by the House of Commons and the House of Lords. ” “In fact, they said it’s not a question of the Prime Minister’s authority to take Britain out of the European Union treaty, it’s an issue dealing with statutory law in Great Britain, because so much European law over these past 30 years has been imposed on Great Britain that it would take an act of Parliament to begin the exit process,” Bolton observed. “I don’t think that’s really going to be an obstacle. I think they in fact are talking about introducing a bill this week. It can be a very short bill. ” “The Labor party and the Liberal Democrats can moan and groan about it all they want, but Theresa May has a solid majority, and I think they’ll push it through,” he predicted. “In fact, I think Labor, the Liberal Democrats in particular, will just do themselves more damage by saying, ‘You know, by God, just because the people voted to leave the European Union doesn’t mean they’re as smart as we are! We’re going to substitute our judgment for theirs and try and prevent it from happening.’ You know, knock yourself out if that’s what you want to do. I just think it’s politically foolish on their part. ” “But I would have preferred a cleaner victory,” he added. “I think this decision to withdraw is prospective only. I don’t see why you need a parliamentary vote. But given the majority the conservatives have, I don’t even think they can slow it down that much. ” John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and presides over his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.

48713,Un tremblement de terre peut effacer Téhéran de la surface de la Terre,"(mis à jour 22:51 26.10.2016) URL courte 5 1033 2 4 Dans 15 à 20 ans, un tremblement de terre dévastateur pourrait secouer Téhéran. Selon Bahram Akkasheh, sismologue iranien qui a accordé une interview à Sputnik, il faudrait examiner la possibilité de transférer la capitale dans des régions moins dangereuses. 
Déjà en 2009, en raison de la localisation de Téhéran dans une zone sismique, l'idée du transfert de la capitale iranienne avait été avancée par l'Ayatollah Khamenei. Suite à son initiative, le Conseil de discernement recommandait de se préparer au transfert de la capitale. © AP Photo/ Niranjan Shrestha Un tremblement de terre géant dans le Pacifique pour bientôt Ces derniers temps, cette idée a gagné en popularité, surtout en raison du scénario apocalyptique proposé par des scientifiques japonais qui mènent des recherches en Iran. Selon eux, le séisme pourrait atteindre sept ou huit sur l'échelle de Richter, ce qui pourrait faire plus d'un million de victimes et provoquer la destruction de 80 % des bâtiments. Les séismes, qui sont devenus récurrents aux alentours de Téhéran, témoignent de l'accumulation d'énergie dangereuse dans le sous-sol. « Le père de la sismologie iranienne », Bahram Akkasheh, a présenté en détail les conditions réelles dans lesquelles se retrouve actuellement la capitale de l'Iran. 
D'après les recherches menées par M. Akkasheh, les tremblements de terre dans les alentours de Téhéran ont un caractère cyclique : le dernier de magnitude 7.1 a secoué Téhéran en 1830 ayant détruit les murs du Palais du Golestan et le bâtiment de la mission diplomatique du Royaume-Uni. Plus de doutes! Le phénomène du Triangle des Bermudes enfin expliqué Les tremblements de terre « ont lieu tous les 200 ans. (…) Si on se réfère au cycle, il existe une possibilité que dans les quinze prochaines années un tremblement de terre secoue Téhéran », a expliqué M. Akkasheh.
Il n'est possible de prédire le début du tremblement de terre que quelques jours ou heures à l'avance, voici pourquoi la menace est imprévisible : « Nulle part dans le monde, ni aux États-Unis, ni au Japon, un début de tremblement de terre n'a été prédit avec certitude. Une fois, en Chine, on a réussi à le faire par hasard », explique le sismologue. 
Selon lui, la possibilité de tremblement de terre à Téhéran est assez haute : 
« Chaque année, la crête d'Alborz grandit de quelques millimètres puisqu'annuellement, le plateau iranien s'étend de huit mm. Tout cela prouve qu'ici, l'écorce terrestre est en mouvement perpétuel ». Italie: ce chat survit après 32 jours dans les décombres après le séisme Il y a plusieurs régions en Iran qui sont exposées aux séismes de magnitude 7 sur l'échelle de Richter. Pourtant, il existe des régions où la magnitude peut atteindre 8 sur l'échelle de Richter et elles sont exposées à un plus grand danger. « Ce n'est pas par hasard que nous avons signé un accord de coopération avec les Japonais pour examiner l'activité sismique des lieux où se trouve Téhéran. Je me souviens que lors de cette recherche commune, le maire de Téhéran avait déclaré qu'à la suite d'un tremblement de terre à Téhéran, le nombre de victimes pourrait se chiffrer en millions. La ville peut être effacée de la surface terrestre », prévient M. Akkasheh. 
Le président de l'Iran a chargé six ministres d'étudier les rapports préparés par M. Akkasheh, et par la suite un état-major de crise a été créé sous contrôle de la mairie. 
« On a crééégalement ces états-majors dans toutes les provinces du pays. Plusieurs provinces, où le risque sismique est le plus fort, ont commencéà se préparer aux cataclysmes naturels. (…) Pourtant, on ne pourra vérifier le niveau réel de l'alerte qu'en pratique », conclut le sismologue.

51399,Review: ‘Bad Santa 2’ Works Through Mommy Issues - The New York Times,"In the hall of fame of   comic characters, between wax works of W. C. Fields and Larry David, there ought to be a monument to Billy Bob Thornton’s work as Willie, the alcoholic safecracker of “Bad Santa. ” As much as Terry Zwigoff’s 2003 film relied on the spectacle of Mr. Thornton soiling himself in a Santa suit or saying unspeakable things to children, the performance was a master class in timing and sly reaction shots. Only Mr. Thornton could have played the role. Now comes a belated sequel, “Bad Santa 2,” directed by Mark Waters (already a connoisseur of bad behavior from “Mean Girls”) whose pitch meeting seems to have proceeded from two unnecessary questions: What if bad Santa weren’t as bad as all that? And what if he had an estranged mother whose conduct is at least as foul as his? Yet even the profanity has lost its zing in this   retread, which mostly prompts admiration for how far Mr. Zwigoff ran with one joke. When we   Willie (Mr. Thornton, looking resigned to his task) he is working as a valet parking attendant, a job that goes south after he is distracted by a   mother. Following our reunion with Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly)  —   Willie has promised to get the kid deflowered for his 21st birthday, which leads to a mortifying interlude with a prostitute (Octavia Spencer)  —   Willie accompanies his former partner (Tony Cox) to a prospective robbery in Chicago. (Shots of the city may be entirely stock footage, as if the movie crew knew tagging along might be a bad idea.) The target is a charity run by Diane (Christina Hendricks) and by her unfaithful husband (Ryan Hansen) who pockets most of the revenue. Dismayed about ripping off    —   mawkishness is the only aspect in which “Bad Santa 2” outpaces its predecessor  —   Willie is not above beating up a street Santa (Mike Starr) who gets into a dispute with him over a spot to stand. Diane, a target for Willie’s lewd advances, takes up the function of Lauren Graham’s character in the first film. If “Bad Santa 2” has anything new to offer, it’s the spectacle of Kathy Bates as Willie’s mom, whom Willie resents. (He offhandedly mentions having taken the fall for her at age 11.) Her remarks about her careless parenting (“Hell, I didn’t even know I’d given birth until I’d tripped over him”) constitute the movie’s best effort at a running joke, and while Ms. Bates can be a nimble scene stealer, decking her out in tattoos and punk jewelry is not enough to spark an uninspired script. “Bad Santa 2” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for Bad S’antics. Running time: 1 hour 32 minutes.",0
59999,"MI BOARD OF EDUCATION Will Allow Students To Choose Gender, Bathroom, Locker Room And Even A New Name With No Parental Consent","Every parent in the United States of America should be alarmed by this covert attempt by Board of Education members to essentially tell our kids that their power supersedes that of the parents. Furthermore, this reckless policy of placing same sex kids in bathrooms and locker rooms puts children in danger of being in private spaces with sexual predators and or sexual offenders Make sure to add your comments to the MI Board of Educations HEREMichigan s State Board of Education has drafted a guidance that would push the state s schools to allow all students, regardless of parental or doctoral input, to choose their gender, name, pronouns, and bathrooms.Spearheaded by board president John C. Austin and signed by state superintendent Brian Whiston, the guidance informs Michigan public schools that only the students themselves i.e. not their parents or doctors can determine what their individual gender identities are. The responsibility for determining a student s gender identity rests with the student. Outside confirmation from medical or mental health professionals, or documentation of legal changes, is not needed,  the guidance states.Gender identity is defined in the guidance as  a person s deeply held internal sense or psychological knowledge of their own gender, regardless of the biological sex they were assigned at birth. Notably, the guidance makes no mention of a student s age affecting whether or not they can pick a gender without their parent or doctor.In fact, the guidance seems to intentionally cut parents out of the process.The guidance states:  School staff should address students by their chosen name and pronouns that correspond to their gender identity, regardless of whether there has been a legal name change. Students can even ask to have their chosen name and gender  included in the district s information management systems, in addition to the student s legal name. But what about when school staff members are speaking with parents about their son or daughter?The guidance states that  Transgender and GNC [gender nonconforming] students have the right to decide when, with whom, and to what extent to share private information. Accordingly, the board makes clear,  When contacting the parent/guardian of a transgender or GNC student, school staff should use the student s legal name and the pronoun corresponding to the student s assigned sex at birth, unless the student or parent/guardian has specified otherwise. In other words, a boy named  Jake  could become a girl named  Jane  at school, seemingly without his parents ever knowing.Names, pronouns, and genders aren t the only things the board wants students to choose.The guidance informs schools that  Students should be allowed to use the restroom in accordance with their gender identity. And the board makes clear that single-stall bathrooms are not inclusive enough:  Alternative and non-stigmatizing options, such as an all-gender or singleuser restroom (e.g., staff bathroom or nurse s office), should be made available to students who request them, but not presented as the only option. Locker rooms also should become inclusive of students  many gender identities.  A student should not be required to use a locker room that is incongruent with their gender identity,  the guidance states.  Locker room usage should be determined on a case-by-case basis, using the guiding principles of safety and honoring the student s gender identity and expression. Students who are bothered by having members of the opposite sex in their locker rooms can request  an adjusted changing schedule  or  use of a private area in the facility. The board quietly issued the statement and guidance on February 23rd, without a press release. The public has only until April 11th to comment on the proposed guidance, according to the Department of Education website. The board will finalize the guidance at a meeting on May 10th.

39660,Le Pen: Pope ’Asks that States Go Against Their Own People’ by Opening Borders,"French presidential frontrunner Marine Le Pen has criticised the Pope for pressuring Western countries to open their borders to migrants, accusing him of asking states to disregard their own citizens. [In an interview with La Croix International, the leader of the Front National chided Pope Francis for asking “that states go against the interests of their own people by not placing conditions on the acceptance of significant numbers of migrants”.  The    added that, in her view, the Argentine cleric’s pronouncements on immigration exceed his role as a religious leader. “To me, this falls within the realm of politics and even interference, since he is also a head of state. ” Pope Francis is technically a foreign leader as Sovereign of the Vatican  —   a walled   with some of the strictest immigration and citizenship rules in the world. Asked about her own religious views, Ms. Le Pen said: “I have a strong faith and I am fortunate in that I have never doubted it. “However, I admit that I am angry with the Church because I think that it interferes in everything except what it should really be concerned with,” she added. Ms. Le Pen also discussed a potential showdown with in the second round of the French elections with Emmanuel Macron, a   politician in the mould of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. “I have always said that I’d like to be up against Emmanuel Macron in the second round because then the choice will be ” she said. “He is an unashamed globalist who wants to speed up the total opening of borders,   and the evisceration of France in favour of private and financial interests. “I, on the other hand, propose a return to the   the most effective structure to ensure security, prosperity, and democracy, and to protect our identity. ”",0
15286,Congress averts government shutdown for now,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress moved rapidly on Thursday to send President Donald Trump a short-term funding bill to avert a government shutdown this weekend, leaving fights over budget priorities and a range of other controversial issues for the coming weeks. The House of Representatives, working against a Friday midnight deadline, approved legislation in a 235-193 vote to fund a wide range of federal programs through Dec. 22.  The Senate followed up by approving the bill 81-14. The White House has said Trump will sign it into law. The measure creates more time for a reckoning between Republicans and Democrats about budget differences, which Trump discussed in a meeting with leading lawmakers at the White House earlier in the day. “We hope that we’re going to make some great progress for our country. I think that will happen,” Trump said. The White House said negotiations would resume on Friday. Leaders now have about two weeks to find common ground on a host of thorny issues for the next government funding bill in order to prevent a partial government shutdown on Dec. 23. Both sides want to avoid having parts of the government close, particularly during the holidays, for fear of a public backlash, and leaders from both parties have preemptively blamed the other for such a potential outcome.  That political blame game is likely to continue in the next two weeks while, behind the scenes, leaders hammer out a compromise.   Republicans mainly want a big increase in defense spending for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2018. But Democrats are insisting that any added Pentagon funding be accompanied by increases to other domestic programs. Democrats also want to enact into law protections for nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who were children when they were brought into the United States.  Republicans want a much wider series of immigration law changes to further clamp down on foreign arrivals, and they want immigration negotiations to be held on a separate track from the government funding bill. Democrats also want to shore up the Affordable Care Act, known as “Obamacare,” by reviving federal subsidies for low-income people in the program. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer joined Trump and Republican congressional leaders for the talks after canceling a similarly planned meeting last week when the president posted a note on Twitter attacking their policy positions. The two Democrats said in a statement that the meeting on Thursday was productive but nothing specific had been agreed. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis joined the group to discuss military matters. The White House foresees a compromise with lawmakers that will include increases in defense and non-defense spending, White House legislative affairs director Marc Short told Reuters.  He said the White House wants a deal that covers spending for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.   Earlier on Thursday, Schumer said Trump seemed to be rooting for a shutdown and warned that, if one occurs, “it will fall on his shoulders.”  “His party controls the Senate, the House and the presidency,” he said. “Nobody here wants to see a shutdown. We Democrats are not interested in one.” Pelosi said Democrats were not willing to shut down the government over the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) immigration program, but she also said “we will not leave here without a DACA fix.” ",0

Musburger said Olbermann, who used to work alongside Dan Patrick, should get back to sports, where people actually “enjoy him. ” “When did Keith Olbermann become this progressive that’s out there leading the banner?” Musburger asked. “I think I was looking for Musburger on Google last night and I’d had enough Irish whiskey that I hit the O button and I looked at Olbermann and he’s calling for the president to resign.

4188,Facebook Criticizes New German ’Hate Speech’ Law for Social Media - Breitbart,"Facebook has criticized new German hate speech law that would see social media companies pay up to €50 million in fines if they fail to remove “hate speech” on their platform. [Business Insider reports that Facebook is unhappy with Germany’s new hate speech law that would force social media companies to face heavy fines for failure to remove hate speech and fake news from their platforms. Facebook has argued that these strict new measures will result in legal and legitimate content being deleted from their platform in order to avoid the fines.  The German government proposed legislation in March that would have social media companies fined if they didn’t quickly remove posts regarded as slanderous or threatening. Germany’s cabinet approved these plans in April, but they have yet to be implemented. The new law has now been challenged by Facebook. Facebook published a statement over the weekend which outlined why the new law “is not suitable to combat hate speech and false news. ” “The draft law provides an incentive to delete content that is not clearly illegal when social networks face such a disproportionate threat of fines,” Facebook claimed. “It would have the effect of transferring responsibility for complex legal decisions from public authorities to private companies. And several legal experts have assessed the draft law as being against the German constitution and   with EU law. Facebook is committed to working in partnership with governments and civil society on solutions that will make this draft law unnecessary. ” German Justice Minister Heiko Maas disagreed, stating, “This (draft law) sets out binding standards for the way operators of social networks deal with complaints and obliges them to delete criminal content. ” He added, “there should be just as little tolerance for criminal rabble rousing on social networks as on the street. ” If Facebook refuses to comply with the law, the individual deemed responsible for the company in German could receive a personal €5 million fine, while Facebook as an organization could receive a fine of up to €50 million.",0
60267,,"If “Peaceful Uprising [is] a climate justice group that describes its task as ‘working to build an uncompromising movement to defend a livable future,’” why does it not recognize that there may BE no such thing?! After all, Dr. David Wasdell ( http://www.apollo-gaia.org/Har... , p. 15) wrote last year: “An increase of 1.5°C was implicit by around 1965. 2°C was implicit by about1978.

23630,"Clinton Foundation to bar foreign, corporate funding if Hillary Clinton elected president","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Clinton Foundation will stop accepting foreign and corporate donations if Hillary Clinton is elected president and will stop holding the annual Clinton Global Initiative meetings whatever the outcome of the November election, a foundation spokesman said on Thursday. Former President Bill Clinton told staff members on Thursday he would resign from the foundation’s board and that it would only accept donations from U.S. citizens and independent charities. The former president also said he would hold the 12th and final Clinton Global Initiative in September. The annual meetings have included current and former heads of state, corporate leaders and celebrities who discussed poverty, healthcare, development and other issues.     Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian confirmed the moves, which were first reported by the Associated Press. The foundation has come under fire during Hillary Clinton’s Democratic presidential campaign, with Republicans charging that donors were rewarded with access to her and her aides as well as her husband while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.  Other critics have said the foundation’s reliance on millions of dollars from foreign governments created conflicts of interest for a would-be U.S. president. Clinton resigned from the foundation’s board after launching her successful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. She will face Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election.  The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, founded in 2001, has raised more than $2 billion for causes that focus on health and environmental issues, mainly in the developing world.  ",0
12819,"As Second Avenue Subway Opens, a Train Delay Ends in (Happy) Tears - The New York Times","Finally. The Second Avenue subway opened in New York City on Sunday, with thousands of riders flooding into its polished stations to witness a piece of history nearly a century in the making. They descended beneath the streets of the Upper East Side of Manhattan to board Q trains bound for Coney Island in Brooklyn. They cheered. Their eyes filled with tears. They snapped selfies in front of colorful mosaics lining the walls of the stations. It was the first day of 2017, and it felt like a new day for a city that for so long struggled to build this sorely needed subway line. In a rare display of unbridled optimism from hardened New Yorkers, they arrived with huge grins and wide eyes, taking in the bells and whistles at three new stations. “I was very choked up,” Betsy Morris, 70, said as she rode the first train to leave the 96th Street station, at noon. “How do you explain something that you never thought would happen? It’s going to change the way everybody lives as far as commuting goes. ” It was a major moment for New York’s sprawling transit system after decades of failed efforts to bring the line to one of the few corners of Manhattan the subway did not reach. The opening of the first segment of the line  —   an extension of the Q train to 96th Street  —   promises to lighten the crush of passengers on the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 trains along Lexington Avenue, the nation’s most overcrowded subway line, which had been the only line on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. When the stations opened shortly before noon, they were quickly filled with giddy riders both young and old, and strollers, suitcases and dogs  —   all familiar sights across the system. But for all the excitement, the line, with just three new stops, is much more modest than the ambitious route running the length of Manhattan that was once envisioned. It serves a relatively affluent and not very diverse part of the city, which has more than eight and a half million people and many   and minority residents who live far from a subway line. With the subway reaching its highest ridership levels since 1948, much of the aging system is plagued by crowding and delays, even as subway and bus fares are expected to rise again in March. Still, there was reason to cheer. The opening of a new subway line is a rare occasion in the United States and comes at a time of mounting concern about the deteriorating state of the nation’s infrastructure, from its roadways and bridges to its public transit systems. Few new subway stations have opened in recent years, even as expansive subway networks have sprouted in Asia, and most American cities never built any in the first place. The major subways in the Northeast  —   in New York, Washington and Boston  —   are grappling with old equipment and funding shortfalls, with Washington experiencing a near meltdown over safety problems. With mounting bills for basic maintenance, these subways have largely failed to grow. So the arrival of the   Second Avenue subway, which was first proposed in the 1920s, was a notable achievement for the   Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city’s vast network of subways, buses and commuter railroads. The first phase of the project took nearly a decade to build and cost about $4. 4 billion. With the opening, the map of the city’s loved and loathed subway adds three new stations, bringing the total to 472  —   the most of any subway in the world. A station that opened at Hudson Yards on Manhattan’s Far West Side in 2015 was the city’s first new station in a  . On Sunday, New Yorkers were mesmerized by the artwork adorning the walls. At the 72nd Street stop, Sumana Harihareswara stopped to gaze at a mosaic of a woman of South Asian descent dressed in a burgundy sari, looking at her cellphone. Ms. Harihareswara was overcome with emotion. “I don’t think I’ve ever come across subway art before that makes me feel so seen,” she said through tears. “This woman could be my aunt she could be my cousin. ” She and a stranger exchanged a knowing glance. “Representation matters,” they agreed. Ms. Harihareswara, a longtime transit enthusiast from Astoria, Queens, said she was struck by the diversity portrayed in the mosaics, including a mural of a gay couple holding hands. “There is no feeling quite like seeing yourself cemented into the infrastructure of New York,” Ms. Harihareswara said. After decades of aborted efforts to build the Second Avenue line, and at least three groundbreakings in the 1970s, construction on the current segment began in 2007. The line was originally projected to open in 2013, but subway officials pushed the deadline to the end of 2016 many years ago. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who effectively controls the authority, pressed officials to meet the December 2016 deadline even as concerns grew that the subway would not be ready in time. Still, the agency made the deadline  —   just barely  —   with a lavish inaugural ride on New Year’s Eve for a collection of dignitaries that culminated in a midnight toast. Although many New Yorkers believe the city runs the subways, it is actually the governor who appoints the authority’s chairman and holds considerable sway over the agency. Mr. Cuomo has capitalized on the Second Avenue opening to raise his national profile, overshadowing his frequent nemesis Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who attended the inaugural ride on Saturday but was not given a speaking slot. Despite general good will over the opening, some transit advocates expressed concerns over the high cost of the project and questioned whether officials would move aggressively to extend the line to 125th Street in East Harlem as planned. On Sunday morning, Mr. Cuomo arrived at the 96th Street station with the authority’s chairman, Thomas F. Prendergast, to join the first trip for regular riders, who cheered as the train pulled out of the station. Then Mr. Cuomo’s voice came over the loudspeaker. “Rest assured: I’m not driving the train,” he joked. The first day of service was smooth, although there were a few hiccups. Around 3 p. m. there were delays on the Q line because of a train with mechanical problems at the City Hall station. About an hour earlier, the elevator at the new 86th Street stop had begun to malfunction, stranding passengers above and below ground. Strollers were wheeled onto steep escalators. Parents became upset. Jill Tallmer, 62, and her mother, Margot Tallmer, 91, contemplated visiting another day. “We’ve been waiting for 10 years, or more, to ride,” the younger Ms. Tallmer said while standing with her mother, a lifelong New Yorker who is in a wheelchair. “Hopefully, it’s almost ready for us. ” It was not, and they left after a few minutes. At the 72nd Street station, George Braith, a jazz saxophonist, was being mobbed by an eager pack of veritable paparazzi. The reason for his newfound celebrity: His likeness is featured in a mosaic there. “Would you look at that guy?” Mr. Braith, 77, said. “Pretty handsome fellow if you ask me. ” He is one of several local celebrities portrayed in the artwork, including chef Daniel Boulud. In Mr. Braith’s mosaic, he is clad in a slick red blazer and carrying his signature Braithophone, alto and soprano saxophones melded into one. Taking the instrument from his suitcase, he obliged the crowd with a brief tune. “Are you famous?” a   asked, seeing the hubbub. “In the jazz world,” Mr. Braith replied. The man shook his head and said, “Well, you’re immortalized as far as I’m concerned. ” Another   celebrant, Ian Ma, 15, lives in Sheepshead Bay, a waterfront neighborhood in southern Brooklyn that is nowhere near the new subway line. But he has been enchanted by trains since he started rolling toy models on the floor as a child, he said, and he cajoled his parents into giving him a ride. “I feel like I’ve been waiting for this train my whole life,” he said, seemingly speaking for many others.",0
