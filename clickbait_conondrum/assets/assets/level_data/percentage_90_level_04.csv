37485,"Mnuchin sees U.S. growth reaching 3 percent in time, tax cuts to help","BEVERLY HILLS (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that economic growth of three percent is achievable in the next two years as the Trump administration sets out to dramatically cut taxes.  Speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, almost a week after he helped unveil plans to cut taxes for many people and corporations to 15 percent, Mnuchin said tax reform and regulatory relief will help spur economic growth. Mnuchin’s comments also come days after government data showed tepid economic growth of 0.7 percent for the last three months. “The tax plan is our version of a jobs bill,” Mnuchin said in an onstage interview with journalist Maria Bartoromo. Although the stock market has reacted positively to Trump’s election - with the S&P 500 index up 11 percent since November - critics of the tax plan have said it is ambitious and lacks details.  In a light-hearted moment, Mnuchin quipped that many at the conference had him to thank for the surge in bank stocks that have helped lift their portfolios, bringing laughter from the audience. But with few fresh details about Trump’s plans and an uncertain time frame, some at the conference expressed concern that the generally optimistic atmosphere might begin to fade. “I’m concerned that if we don’t see tax or healthcare reform by the end of the year, markets will start to doubt the administration’s ability to deliver it,” said Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners.  Mnuchin said he has been working with congressional leaders to push tax reform and he hopes for bi-partisan support.  Mnuchin told CNBC on the sidelines of the conference that the tax proposal was purposely vague so that the administration could work with legislators to craft something that will pass Congress. The Trump administration has invited many business leaders into the White House and is listening closely to their concerns and hopes on tax changes, he added.  David Solomon, president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, said the great sense of optimism early in Trump’s tenure may be fading some. “This quarter it feels like conviction for tax and regulatory reform is more muted.” Solomon’s predecessor at Goldman, Gary Cohn, joined the Trump administration as director of the National Economic Council and one of his primary goals has been to work on tax reform. One concern associated with the Trump tax plan is how the government plans to pay for it. Mnuchin said that there are plenty of other ways to off set the revenue that would be lost through reduced tax receipts. He did not offer many specifics. Indeed many at the conference, including investment managers whose businesses could benefit dramatically from the cut in taxes, were cheering the new administration and its can-do attitude which also includes plans to tackle health care reform. Prospects for growth look to be better around the world, several said. Yet there were also some rumblings of concern that ambitious projects would not be completed and that tensions around the world with other governments would increase. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, said that optimism is off the charts according to the stock market but geopolitical issues are a real concern.

44931,House speaker: May need a temporary bill to fund government past Dec. 8,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers may have to pass another stop-gap spending bill in order to keep the federal government operating Dec. 8 when existing money runs out, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters on Tuesday. Asked about the timing of the budget process and the measure now in place to fund government operations through early December at last year’s levels, Ryan told a news conference, “We might need a little bit more time to give the appropriators time to write their bill” for fiscal 2018 spending that would extend through next Sept. 30. Ryan said a temporary spending bill, if needed while the longer-term one is being negotiated, would extend for a short time. “We are not talking about going into next year,” he said. ",0
56993,Some members of Trump team can begin agency briefings: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team can now begin work with officials at certain government agencies as they prepare for the new administration to take over in January, the White House said on Thursday.  “The President-elect’s team has now completed the necessary steps for an initial group of authorized individuals to begin receiving briefings and other materials from our transition teams at select agencies across the government,” said White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine in a statement. “We expect to receive additional names for a wider range of agencies from the President-elect’s team as the transition work continues, and we will facilitate those requests on a rolling basis,” Hoffine said.

11874,Conviction Thrown Out for Ex-Rutgers Student in Tyler Clementi Case - The New York Times,"An appeals court in New Jersey on Friday threw out the conviction of the former roommate of Tyler Clementi, the Rutgers University freshman who killed himself six years ago after he was spied on while having sex with another man. The Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey in Newark overturned a lower court’s conviction of the   Dharun Ravi, on several counts of bias intimidation because of a change in state law. The court called for a new trial of Mr. Ravi on 10 other counts that included invasion of privacy and tampering with evidence. Mr. Ravi was convicted in 2012 in a case that drew international attention to the bullying of gay teenagers after Mr. Clementi jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge. Mr. Clementi’s life and death were taken up by advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, and the case delved into the risks that are sometimes associated with coming out as Mr. Clementi had struggled with questions about his sexuality. Mr. Clementi’s suicide at age 18 came just days after he learned that Mr. Ravi had used a webcam to spy on him and had used social media to invite others to watch a sexual encounter in the dormitory room Mr. Clementi shared with Mr. Ravi. Mr. Ravi was not charged in his roommate’s death, and Mr. Clementi did not leave behind an explanation of what drove him to kill himself. Some of the charges on which Mr. Ravi was convicted fell under a state statute on bias intimidation that was unlike any other in the United States. The statute said defendants could be convicted if their victims “reasonably believed” that they were harassed or intimidated because of a characteristic such as race or sexual orientation. But last year, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the   law was unconstitutional. The court threw out those charges and concluded that the evidence that prosecutors presented to prove them had “tainted the jury’s verdict on the remaining charges” and deprived Mr. Ravi of a fair trial. Lawrence S. Lustberg, a lawyer who argued that the   law was unconstitutional, said that the appeals court had little choice but to decide that the convictions reached using that statute were wrong. Having done that, it was “pretty straightforward” to conclude “that the whole trial was deeply infected by that error,” Mr. Lustberg said. The Middlesex County prosecutor’s office will now have to decide whether to appeal or to try Mr. Ravi again on the other 10 charges. After apologizing for his actions, Mr. Ravi served 20 days in jail on some of the charges and was ordered to pay $10, 000 to a program to help victims of hate crimes. But Mr. Clementi’s parents, Joe and Jane, rejected the “  apology” as a “  piece. ” They also criticized the judge, Glenn Bermen of State Superior Court, for not sentencing Mr. Ravi to jail for bias crimes, saying he missed a chance to highlight their seriousness. A spokesman for the Middlesex prosecutor’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Ravi’s lawyer, Steven D. Altman, also did not reply to requests for comment on Friday. Joe and Jane Clementi responded to the ruling with a statement released through the Tyler Clementi Foundation, which they founded to help end bullying. “In light of today’s decision, we will do what we encourage all people to do before they push that send button, and that is to pause and consider the implications of their message,” the statement said. “Does it encourage and build someone up or does it destroy and harm another person? Our world moves very fast which pushes us to be impulsively spontaneous and sometimes harsh. ” Reached by phone on Friday evening, Ms. Clementi said the prosecutors told her that they would notify her family next week about how they would proceed. She said she did not have an opinion on whether the litigation should continue. “Social media is a great tool, but it can be used for good and it can be used for harm and destruction,” Ms. Clementi said. “This just fosters my desire to keep moving and make sure that other people hear this and know this. ” The appeals court judges did not minimize their disapproval of what Mr. Ravi had done. “The social environment that transformed a private act of sexual intimacy into a grotesque voyeuristic spectacle must be unequivocally condemned in the strongest possible way,” the opinion said. “The fact that this occurred in a university dormitory, housing   college students, only exacerbates our collective sense of disbelief and disorientation,” it continued. “All of the young men and women who had any association with this tragedy must pause to reflect and assess whether this experience has cast an indelible moral shadow on their character. ”",0
45827,Obama takes Supreme Court fight to Republican senators' home turf,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday took the political battle over his pick for a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court to the home states of seven Republican senators up for re-election in November. Obama conducted interviews with local television anchors where he argued that Republican senators should hold confirmation hearings and vote on his nomination of appellate Judge Merrick Garland to the top court. “What my argument is: Let the American people see Judge Garland, let him answer questions, let them hear his responses,” the Democratic president told WDAF-TV FOX 4 in Kansas City, Missouri, a market that straddles states where Senators Roy Blunt of Missouri and Jerry Moran of Kansas are up for re-election. Republican leaders have been resolute that Obama’s successor, who will be elected on Nov. 8 and take office on Jan. 20, should fill the vacancy left by February’s death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Republicans are hoping their party’s candidate wins the presidency and can make the appointment. The court is now split 4-4 between conservatives and liberals, meaning Scalia’s successor could influence its ideological direction for years to come.     Obama has argued the Senate has a responsibility to formally consider Garland’s nomination, telling ABC affiliate WMUR in Manchester, New Hampshire, that the judge was “maybe the most qualified nominee that we’ve seen before the Senate for a Supreme Court seat.” New Hampshire’s Kelly Ayotte is viewed as one of the most vulnerable Senate Republican incumbents. She met with Garland but wants the Senate to wait until after the election to act on the nomination. “I know that folks like Senator Ayotte met with him and the fact that they’re not calling a hearing or vote means they’re not doing their job,” Obama said in the interview. In a separate interview with WMUR, Ayotte defended her position. “In my view waiting for the election, we are in the midst of a presidential nomination process, to have the people weigh in the election in November is important considering we have a 4-4 court,” she said. Obama also talked with a television anchor from Iowa, home to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who has helped lead efforts to block Garland. The president spoke as well with anchors from Ohio, where Senator Rob Portman faces a competitive re-election race; Wisconsin, where Senator Ron Johnson is running again; and Phoenix, home to Senator John McCain of Arizona.

60737,Iraq says ruling against Trump travel ban is move in right direction,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq is satisfied with a U.S. appeals court ruling against a travel ban imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, a government spokesman said on Sunday. The ruling given late on Saturday denied a request from the U.S. Department of Justice to immediately restore Trump’s order, which a judge in Washington state had blocked on Friday. “It is a move in the right direction to solve the problems that it caused,” the Iraqi spokesman, Saad al-Hadithi, told Reuters. Trump’s executive order last week put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from seven majority Muslim countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Religious minorities persecuted by the Islamic State group, and other Iraqis fleeing violence, were among those affected. The ban would have prevented a total of 20,000 people in “precarious circumstances” in the seven countries targeted from  resettling in the U.S. during the 120 days covered by the suspension, according to the United Nations. Baghdad protested against the ban, calling it unfair and saying that no Iraqi had been involved in attacks on U.S. soil. But it refrained from retaliating as it seeks to maintain U.S. support for Iraqi forces battling Islamic State in Mosul. The U.S. has more than 5,000 troops deployed in Iraq, providing critical air and ground support for Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting the militants, who declared a self-styled caliphate over parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014.

11534,Senate banking chair wants financial rules reform by early 2018,"(Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee said on Thursday he wants to pass a major piece of bank reform legislation by early next year at the latest. Senator Mike Crapo, a Republican, intends to go beyond rewriting the 2010 Dodd Frank financial reform legislation and craft a bipartisan bill that advances economic growth and capital formation, he told attendees at a Chamber of Commerce event focused on capital markets. “My hope is ... that is either late this year or early next year. I’m not looking further than that,” Crapo said. Crapo’s agenda is being intensely watched on Wall Street, as his committee is widely seen as playing a critical role in crafting any rewrite of Dodd Frank.  That 2010 law was enacted after the financial crisis, and the industry is eager to see if Republicans now in charge of the White House and Congress can significantly relax its requirements. Some of the Dodd Frank provisions that are most contentious prohibit banks from some higher risk investments and require higher capital requirements of the biggest banks.  A bill that attacks Dodd Frank directly is set to be introduced in the House of Representatives soon by Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who chairs the Financial Services Committee. But that bill is seen as a tough Republican approach that may not garner enough support in the Senate to be passed. Crapo said meaningful reforms would require a bipartisan approach, and he is working closely with Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the committee, to find areas of common ground. He also said he wants to go beyond simply revisiting Dodd Frank’s provisions and look more broadly at all rules and policies that impact economic growth, an approach he said might encourage Democrats to vote with him. He said he expects Congress to address financial regulatory reform after it finishes work on a tax reform bill.  Crapo did concede that the current political environment is tough for passing controversial legislation in the Senate, and others in his party said they intend to push some of their favored Dodd Frank revisions through a budget process that would not require much Democratic support.

23221,NYC’S “PROGRESSIVE” MAYOR BEHAVES LIKE A 2-YEAR OLD: DeBlasio literally stares down former Mayor Giuliani,"WHAT A NUT! New York s Mayor DeBlasio gives the evil eye and stares down former Mayor Giuliani or criticizing him for the liberal policies that have lead to a surge of homelessness on the streets.Mayor de Blasio couldn t hide his feelings about nemesis Rudy Giuliani, giving him a piercing stare Friday during the 9/11 ceremony at Ground Zero. Only hours before they shared the stage at the solemn event, Giuliani for the second time this week criticized de Blasio for misrepresenting the city s homeless crisis.  OK, here s how ignorant Mayor de Blasio is. He said that there were 40 percent more homeless people during my administration,  Giuliani said on Fox 5, adding the mayor misquoted that statistic, which The New York Times put at 32 percent. Giuliani also said the spike was only in the shelter population, not in the number of homeless on the street.  People who are in shelters, I would like to inform the mayor, are not homeless,  Giuliani sniffed. The two mayors have been locked in a war of words since Giuliani blasted de Blasio and his  progressive views  for allowing vagrants to sleep on the streets in a Post op-ed last Sunday. De Blasio fired back, calling the ex-mayor  delusional  and saying homelessness rose by 40 percent under his watch between 1994 to 2001.  [Giuliani] clearly doesn t remember the fact that he chased   as he said   he chased and chased people, but he also deprived families of benefits they needed and health care they needed,  de Blasio said earlier this week. But Giuliani patted himself and his successor, ex-Mayor Mike Bloomberg, on the back for cleaning up the streets.  All you had to do was live in this city and you know that when I was mayor, there was very little homelessness in this city. They were in shelters,  Giuliani told Fox 5 on Friday.Read more: NYP",1
50408, Ted Cruz’s Crazy Dad Goes Off About What Will Happen If His Son Doesn’t Win The Election (AUDIO),"Since Jeb Bush started to bring his mother Barbara Bush with him on the campaign trail, it s become more common for the parents of the Republican presidential candidates to swoop in and give their struggling little GOPers a boost.Pastor Rafael Cruz, the father of Texas senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz, tried to do the same for his own son during a chat with Greg Corombos of WorldNetDaily over the weekend, to basically talk about how his son is going to  eclipse Trump and emerge as the nominee.  Considering that Rafael is Ted s campaign surrogate and a religious man, this of course meant some fear-mongering and crazy Christianity references similar to the time he claimed that God was raising up Ted to be the next POTUS.This time, the elder Cruz was on a real mission to convince America that God is behind his son s candidacy and will make sure that he wins the election. Rafael said: I think what is going to happen is the body of Christ is going to rise up. Believers are coalescing around Ted Cruz and I think when the people of God realize that we need a man of faith, a man of integrity, a man that you can trust his word   two things you can count on Ted Cruz, number one he will tell you the truth, and number two, he will do exactly what he says he s going to do. That Rafael called his son a  man of truth  is hilarious, as Cruz was just slammed in the media for spreading false information about Marco Rubio. Rafael also boasted about his son s ability to be the most outspoken homophobe running for president. Rafael reference the Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality, proudly stating that his son was the only candidate who said the ruling was  not the law of the land, this is an unconstitutional, unlawful decision and five justices have no right to impose their view upon 320 million Americans. Rafael topped off his insane claims with a warning, reminding Americans that  this election is the most important election of our lifetime,  and that if they didn t vote Ted into the White House,  a lot of our freedoms would disappear .You can listen to the crazy interview below:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/248365072  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Rafael Cruz honestly just makes his son look like an even more terrifying candidate whenever he speaks. And now that Jeb Bush has just dropped out of the presidential race, Ted might want to rethink having his bible-thumping dad involved in his campaign affairs. Clearly, the GOP needs much more help than mom and dad can give.Featured image is a screenshot",1
66231,The Problems With Facebook’s Polarization Study,"Yesterday, Facebook released a study in Science that pushed back on the idea of the “filter bubble“: that social media creates a kind of echo chamber in which users never see arguments from the other side, helping to insulate those users from substantive political debate. Taken to its extreme, the Filter Bubble might almost completely close users off to new ideas and information, leaving them in a digital world where their viewpoints go ever unchallenged — and contributing to political polarization.

“Facebook Use Polarizing? Site Begs to Differ,” the New York Times headline read. “You would think that if there was an echo chamber, you would not be exposed to any conflicting information,” a data scientist who worked on the study said, “but that’s not the case here.”

But looking at the study, I came to very different conclusions. It absolutely shows that the “filter bubble” exists among some users, and that Facebook and its algorithms play a significant role in creating that bubble. But I can only make that claim about a small number of users that are likely not at all representative of the broader Facebook population, because Facebook relied on such an unusual sample of its users. In other words, despite the buzz this study is getting, we still don’t have a very good sense of how Facebook and other social-media services might or might not contribute to polarization.

As pointed out by Nathan Jurgenson, the study only looks at people who self-identify their political orientation on the site. That means it only examines 9 percent of users, a number you’d only see if you read through the appendix, he notes. It also only looks at Facebook users who log in four to seven days a week, and who meet a few other criteria as well. That nudges the proportion of users examined in the study down to just 4 percent, or about 10 million users.

Are those 4 percent of users representative of Facebook’s user base as a whole? Well, they aren’t randomly sampled. We know that identifying your political affiliation is a fairly rare behavior, given that fewer than one in ten users bothers to do so. My guess is that those users are much more politically engaged and likely much more partisan than the average user, and that’s probably going to affect what they click on and whom they are friends with. But how and how much that matters, I cannot say.

There could also be something different about those Facebook users who log in frequently — maybe they post more or leave more comments. Again, we don’t know. But the point is that if you want to make any broad conclusions about a big population based on a study, you need a random, representative sample. You can’t survey three rich guys in Greenwich and declare that “America’s” favorite food is caviar.

Social-media experts and data scientists are taking Facebook to task for not making all this clearer. “At first, I read this quickly and I took this to mean that out of the at least 200 million Americans who have used Facebook, the researchers selected a ‘large’ sample that was representative of Facebook users,” writes Christian Sandvig of the University of Michigan. “The ‘limitations’ section discusses the demographics of ‘Facebook’s users,’ as would be the normal thing to do if they were sampled. There is no information about the selection procedure in the article itself.”

But even setting aside the sample issues, the study clearly does not show that those unusual users are exposed to a diverse set of viewpoints, nudged along by the Facebook algorithm. It shows that they see a fairly skewed set of viewpoints, with the Facebook algorithm contributing to the skew. Facebook filters out about 1 in 20 “cross-cutting” hard-news stories for conservatives and about 1 in 13 “cross-cutting” hard-news stories for liberals.

Facebook attempts to distance itself from filter-bubble accusations by noting that individuals isolate themselves, too, with self-identified conservatives clicking on 17 percent fewer “cross-cutting” news stories than would be expected if they clicked at random, and liberals, 6 percent fewer. The company used that finding to argue that it plays less of a role than individuals themselves. But that’s only true for conservatives — not for liberals.

And it’s not clear that Facebook can or should be arguing that it plays a smaller filtering role than individuals, given how the study was conducted in the first place and given that the two findings do not seem directly comparable. “I cannot remember a worse apples to oranges comparison I’ve seen recently, especially since these two dynamics, algorithmic suppression and individual choice, have cumulative effects,” writes Zeynep Tufekci of the University of North Carolina.

No, the filter bubble feels like a very real phenomenon, and Facebook has just shown that for some users, it contributes to it. On social media, we hear what we want to hear, see what we want to see, and click what we want to click. Don’t let Facebook tell you otherwise.",0
30769,Chicago schools budget counts on uncertain funding,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A fiscal 2018 budget unveiled on Friday by the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) depends on nearly $570 million in new money from the state and city that may not materialize or has not been identified. The $5.7 billion spending plan for the fiscal year that began July 1 includes $300 million the state of Illinois would send the district under education funding legislation. But Republican Governor Bruce Rauner used an amendatory veto to substantially rewrite the bill to remove what he called a CPS bailout. It was unclear how much the district would receive under Rauner’s revisions.  The Democratic-controlled legislature, which passed the funding formula bill in May without a veto-proof majority, is scheduled to meet next week. A failure by the Illinois House and Senate to muster a required three-fifths majority vote to override or accept changes Rauner made to the bill would kill the measure.  “The budget we released today is more of an outline than a traditional budget as we wait for the resolution of the education funding stalemate in Springfield,” CPS CEO Forrest Claypool told reporters, referring to the state capital. Escalating pension payments have led to drained reserves, debt dependency and junk bond ratings for the nation’s third-largest public school system. The CPS budget also assumes a $269 million boost in local funding that the district said it is working with the city to identify. Matt McGrath, a spokesman for Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who controls the school system, said there is no answer yet on a local source. “What I can tell you is that any local solution will not come at the expense of the city’s long-term financial stability,” he said, adding that the mayor promises CPS students will have a full school year. Moody’s Investors Service put Chicago’s Ba1 junk credit rating under review last month for a possible downgrade, citing the potential the city could extend financial help to its cash-strapped schools. The amount of CPS cash-flow borrowing in fiscal 2018 would be about the same as fiscal 2017’s $1.55 billion, according to budget documents. Claypool said the district has no immediate plans for selling bonds for capital needs. CPS, which projects an 8,000 enrollment drop this school year, has set an Aug. 28 budget vote by its board. The district said the spending plan can be revised once the state puts a school funding formula in place.  ",0
22561,Pentagon Unit Considered Setting Up a Secret Overseas Prison - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   As the Central Intelligence Agency was setting up its secret prisons overseas 15 years ago to interrogate terrorism suspects, a Defense Department unit was considering a proposal to establish a secret military prison abroad, according to previously undisclosed government documents. The proposal was presented in a 2002 memo written in part by Bruce Jessen, one of two psychologists who eventually helped create the C. I. A. ’s “enhanced interrogation” program. The memo, obtained by The New York Times, recommended opening at least one secret overseas site where prisoners would be subjected to “constant sensory deprivation” and develop “ a profound sense of despair. ” The military, though, did not act on the proposal for an “undisclosed  . S. unsuspected, secure location” to “hold, manage and exploit detainees. ” The Department of Defense, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on the extent to which the plan, which originated in the military’s Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, was considered. Aside from sensory deprivation, the memo suggested that additional pressure tactics be permitted against prisoners, including those that “maximize cultural undesirability,” but it did not mention the brutal physical coercion techniques, such as waterboarding, later approved for use in the C. I. A. prisons. The memo is included among several government documents provided during the discovery process in a lawsuit brought in federal court in Spokane, Wash. against Dr. Jessen and the other psychologist, James E. Mitchell, by two former C. I. A. prisoners and the representative of a third man, who died in custody. The documents, along with others previously released, are helping to fill in gaps in the historical record about the interrogation program of the George W. Bush era. Their disclosure comes soon after the Trump administration drafted an executive order calling for reviving the C. I. A. “black site” prisons, though the White House has since appeared to back off from the idea after lawmakers and cabinet officials objected. Also disclosed in the lawsuit were a series of PowerPoint training slides for American personnel apparently headed to the military detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, discussing how they could defeat efforts by terrorism suspects to resist questioning. Those slides  —   or a similar set  —   were used in a training course by Dr. Jessen and a colleague in March 2002, and excerpted in a 2008 Senate Armed Services Committee report. Among the potential methods listed are “psychological torture” through “isolation, threats against self or family” and “the use of drugs. ” When Dr. Jessen’s memo was written in April 2002, he was the chief psychologist at the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, a Defense Department unit overseeing training programs in which military personnel are subjected to simulated torture tactics and mock interrogation to prepare them for possible capture by regimes violating the laws of war. Dr. Jessen and most of his colleagues had no experience in conducting actual interrogations, but the Department of Defense legal counsel sought information from the agency on detainee “exploitation” beginning in late 2001. Dr. Jessen soon left his military position to help set up the C. I. A. interrogation program, along with Dr. Mitchell. The two men eventually created their own company, Mitchell, Jessen and Associates, which received $81 million from the C. I. A. to manage the program. The existence of the 2002 memo was mentioned in the Senate report on detainee abuse published in 2008, but the document itself had not previously been made public. The memo recommended practices similar to those later used at C. I. A. sites, such as holding only one or two “subjects” at a time and having an “operational team” that included a psychologist, interrogators, interpreters, guards, a physician, an intelligence officer and other support personnel, including video technicians. The plan called for “  feed between interrogation rooms, confinement cells and control room. ” It also described ethically conflicting roles for the physician  —   both advising interrogators and treating the subject. The memo was written at a time when Pentagon officials were deeply divided over the military’s role in detention and interrogation in the new war on terrorists. Many officials were already uneasy about interrogation procedures being used at the military detention center in Guantánamo Bay. The memo’s solution to the mounting internal criticism was to have a small team led by the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency run a smaller, more efficient prison. The memo also insisted that secrecy be paramount and that the International Committee of the Red Cross, which monitors prisoners of war to ensure they are treated humanely, be kept out of the proposed prison. “No press, IRC, US or foreign observers,” the memo states. “These documents reveal some of the earliest planning for the systematic torture and abuse that Jessen and others would inflict on U. S. prisoners,” said Dror Ladin, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the former detainees. The emphasis on keeping the prisons hidden showed, Mr. Ladin said, that those involved in the plans “knew that what they were doing was wrong. ” Asked about the documents, a lawyer for Dr. Jessen distanced him from them. “While Dr. Jessen was the original author of the JPRA report, the document that the government produced in discovery is the final version that was modified by other government officials for specific purposes,” said the lawyer, James Smith, who also represents Dr. Mitchell. “Dr. Jessen had no role in creating that final version,” he wrote. Mr. Smith also asserted that “every action taken by Drs. Mitchell and Jessen was approved and directed by the C. I. A. after the Department of Justice and the Office of the President advised that the contemplated action was legal. ” He said the two men had no involvement in activities alleged in the plaintiffs’ complaint, which claimed the psychologists had designed and administered the C. I. A. ’s brutal interrogation program. According to the Senate report, Dr. Jessen drafted his memo and sent it to the senior civilian leadership and commander of the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, Col. John R. Moulton, who is known as Randy. He requested that Dr. Jessen prepare a briefing to “take up for approval. ” When interviewed by the Senate committee, Colonel Moulton testified that he did not recall any subsequent briefings for United States Joint Forces Command on the proposal. Lawyers for Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Jessen have sought to depose several former C. I. A. officials in an effort to buttress the defense’s argument that the psychologists’ actions were approved by the C. I. A. Lawyers for the A. C. L. U. working with the Gibbons law firm of Newark, have said that they were trying to avoid asking the government to release classified information in the case, and instead were relying heavily on public records. Their strategy is to avoid demanding any information that might lead to the imposition of the state secrets privilege, which allows the government to prevent information from being made public in court cases by claiming it could damage national security. That could shut down the case. If it goes forward, a trial is expected to take place in June. In a filing in the case last week, Chad A. Readler, the acting United States assistant attorney general, and other government lawyers indicated that the government would seek to invoke the privilege to block testimony by James Cotsana, a former C. I. A. operations officer who Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Jessen have said supervised them at one time. The Justice Department requested additional time to invoke the state secrets privilege, it said, because the new C. I. A. director will need to assess whether to do so, and the attorney general will have to approve the plan. The multiple levels of review, the government added, “present unique challenges in this case given the recent change of administration. ” Subpoenas to depose John A. Rizzo, a former acting general counsel of the C. I. A. and Jose A. Rodriguez, a former deputy director of operations, were recently canceled by the defendants, who received statements from the two men instead. The A. C. L. U. is now seeking to depose them.",0
65576,8 Parcel Bombs Are Found in Greece - The New York Times,"ATHENS  —   Greek counterterrorism officers have uncovered eight parcel bombs resembling those sent last week to the German finance minister in Berlin and to the Paris offices of the International Monetary Fund, a police official said on Tuesday. The devices were discovered on Monday during a search of the Hellenic Post’s main sorting office, north of Athens, according to a police spokesman, Theodoros Chronopoulos. “The packages were destined for European countries,” he said, calling them “similar” to the ones sent to the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, and to the I. M. F. ’s offices. According to reports in the Greek news media, which Mr. Chronopoulos did not confirm, the packages intercepted at the Athens sorting office were addressed to European Union officials and to multinational companies. The targets reportedly included the leader of the eurozone group of finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who coordinates meetings on Greek bailout talks, and an unidentified official of the European Central Bank, one of Greece’s three main international creditors. European Union finance ministers meeting on Tuesday in Brussels to discuss issues including tax policy were made aware of the parcel bombs, but they did not interrupt their talks. “Certainly, we are following these developments with concern,” Valdis Dombrovskis, a vice president of the European Commission, said. According to the Greek news reports, the senders listed on the packages were two former Greek finance ministers, Gikas Hardouvelis and Yanis Varoufakis, who led bailout negotiations. It was unclear why their names were chosen, but the authorities say they do not believe either man had anything to do with the matter. The parcel bombs sent to Mr. Schäuble and to the I. M. F. ’s offices in Paris bore the names of two Greek opposition lawmakers who are broadly perceived in Greece as backing the bold economic changes being pushed by the country’s creditors. The letter bomb sent to the I. M. F. ’s offices in Paris exploded on Thursday, slightly injuring the worker who opened it. A day earlier, staff members at the German Finance Ministry in Berlin intercepted a parcel bomb sent to Mr. Schäuble. Each device contained small quantities of gunpowder, according to the authorities. A Greek extremist group called Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire claimed responsibility for the parcel addressed to Mr. Schäuble but made no reference to the Paris attack or to any other possible targets. In a statement on an anarchist website, the group said it would issue a “proclamation” with more details, fueling speculation about further attacks and a resurgence of domestic terrorism in Greece, where bailout talks have dragged on and political and economic instability are rising. Mr. Chronopoulos said the new parcel bombs “appear” to be the work of the same group. “We don’t know yet but it seems so,” he said. The Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire claimed responsibility for parcel bombs sent in 2010. One was addressed to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and intercepted at her office. Another was sent to Silvio Berlusconi, Italy’s prime minister at the time, and was intercepted at the Bologna airport. (It exploded, but caused no injuries.) A third, meant for France’s president at the time, Nicolas Sarkozy, was stopped in Athens, along with a package addressed to Eurojust, the European Union’s judicial cooperation agency, in the Netherlands. Several more were sent to embassies in Athens. One, addressed to the Mexican Embassy, exploded in the hands of a courier, causing minor injuries.",0
23207,"Prince, an Artist Who Defied Genre, Is Dead at 57 - The New York Times","Prince, the songwriter, singer, producer,   studio band and consummate showman, died on Thursday at his home, Paisley Park, in Chanhassen, Minn. He was 57. His publicist, Yvette   confirmed his death but did not report a cause. In a statement, the Carver County sheriff, Jim Olson, said that deputies responded to an emergency call at 9:43 a. m. “When deputies and medical personnel arrived,” he said, “they found an unresponsive adult male in the elevator. Emergency medical workers attempted to provide lifesaving CPR, but were unable to revive the victim. He was pronounced deceased at 10:07 a. m. ” The sheriff’s office said it would continue to investigate his death. Last week, responding to news reports that Prince’s plane had made an emergency landing because of a health scare, Ms.   said Prince was “fighting the flu. ” Prince was a man bursting with music  —   a wildly prolific songwriter, a virtuoso on guitars, keyboards and drums and a master architect of funk, rock, RB and pop, even as his music defied genres. In a career that lasted from the late 1970s until his solo “Piano  a Microphone” tour this year, he was acclaimed as a sex symbol, a musical prodigy and an artist who shaped his career his way, often battling with accepted   practices. “When I first started out in the music industry, I was most concerned with freedom. Freedom to produce, freedom to play all the instruments on my records, freedom to say anything I wanted to,” he said when he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. In a tribute to George Harrison that night, Prince went on to play a guitar solo in “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” that left the room floored. A   Grammy winner, Prince had Top 10 hits like “Little Red Corvette,” “When Doves Cry,” “Let’s Go Crazy,” “Kiss” and “The Most Beautiful Girl in the World” albums like “Dirty Mind,” “1999” and “Sign O’ the Times” were   statements. His songs also became hits for others, among them “Nothing Compares 2 U” for Sinead O’Connor, “Manic Monday” for the Bangles and “I Feel for You” for Chaka Khan. With the 1984 film and album “Purple Rain,” he told a fictionalized version of his own story: biracial (although Prince’s parents were both  ) gifted, spectacularly ambitious. Its music won him an Academy Award, and the album sold more than 13 million copies in the United States alone. In a statement, President Obama said, “Few artists have influenced the sound and trajectory of popular music more distinctly, or touched quite so many people with their talent. ” He added, “He was a virtuoso instrumentalist, a brilliant bandleader, and an electrifying performer. ‘A strong spirit transcends rules,’ Prince once said  —   and nobody’s spirit was stronger, bolder, or more creative. ” Prince recorded the great majority of his music entirely on his own, playing every instrument and singing every vocal line. Many of his albums were simply credited, “Produced, arranged, composed and performed by Prince. ” Then, performing those songs onstage, he worked as a bandleader in the polished, athletic, ecstatic tradition of James Brown, at once spontaneous and utterly precise, riveting enough to open a Grammy Awards telecast and play the Super Bowl halftime show. He would often follow a   arena concert with a   club show, pouring out even more music. On Prince’s biggest hits, he sang passionately, affectionately and playfully about sex and seduction. With deep bedroom eyes and a sly, knowing smile, he was one of pop’s ultimate flirts: a sex symbol devoted to romance and pleasure, not power or machismo. Elsewhere in his catalog were songs that addressed social issues and delved into mysticism and science fiction. He made himself a unifier of dualities  —   racial, sexual, musical, cultural  —   teasing at them in songs like “Controversy” and transcending them in his career. He had plenty of eccentricities: his fondness for the color purple, using “U” for “you” and a drawn eye for “I” long before textspeak, his vigilant policing of his music online, his penchant for releasing troves of music at once, his intensely private persona. Yet for musicians and listeners of multiple generations, he was admired   universally. Prince’s music had an immediate and lasting influence: among songwriters concocting   among producers working on dance grooves, among studio experimenters and stage performers. He sang as a soul belter, a rocker, a bluesy ballad singer and a falsetto crooner. His most immediately recognizable (and widely imitated) instrumental style was a particular kind of pinpoint, staccato funk, defined as much by keyboards as by the rhythm section. But that was just one among the many styles he would draw on and blend, from hard rock to psychedelia to electronic music. His music was a cornucopia of ideas: triumphantly, brilliantly kaleidoscopic. Prince Rogers Nelson was born in Minneapolis on June 7, 1958, the son of John L. Nelson, a musician whose stage name was Prince Rogers, and Mattie Della Shaw, a jazz singer who had performed with the Prince Rogers Band. They were separated in 1965, and his mother remarried in 1967. Prince spent some time living with each parent and immersed himself in music, teaching himself to play his instruments. “I think you’ll always be able to do what your ear tells you,” he told his high school newspaper, according to the biography “I Would Die 4 U: Why Prince Became an Icon” (2013) by the critic Touré. Eventually he ran away, living for some time in the basement of a neighbor whose son, André Anderson, would later record as André Cymone. As high school students they formed a band that would also include Morris Day, later the leader of the Time. In classes, Prince also studied the music business. He recorded with a Minneapolis band, 94 East, and began working on his own solo recordings. He was still a teenager when he was signed to Warner Bros. Records, in a deal that included full creative control. His first album, “For You” (1978) gained only modest attention. But his second, “Prince” (1979) started with “I Wanna Be Your Lover,” a No. 1 RB hit that reached No. 11 on the pop charts the album sold more than a million copies, and for the next two decades Prince albums never failed to reach the Top 100. During the 1980s, nearly all were   that reached the Top 10. With his third album, the pointedly titled “Dirty Mind,” Prince moved from typical RB romance to raunchier, more graphic scenarios he posed on the cover against a backdrop of bedsprings and added more rock guitar to his music. It was a clear signal that he would not let formats or categories confine him. “Controversy,” in 1981, had Prince taunting, “Am I black or white?  I straight or gay?” His audience was broadening the Rolling Stones chose him as an opening act for part of their tour that year. Prince grew only more prolific. His next album, “1999,” was a double LP the video for one of its hit singles, “Little Red Corvette,” became one of the first songs by an   musician played in heavy rotation on MTV. He was also writing songs with and producing the female group Vanity 6 and the funk band Morris Day and the Time, which would have a prominent role in “Purple Rain. ” Prince played “the Kid,” escaping an abusive family to pursue rock stardom, in “Purple Rain. ” Directed by Albert Magnoli on a budget of $7 million, it was Prince’s film debut and his transformation from stardom to superstardom. With No. 1 hits in “Let’s Go Crazy” and “When Doves Cry,” he at one point in 1984 had the No. 1 album, single and film simultaneously. He also drew some opposition. “Darling Nikki,” a song on the album that refers to masturbation, shocked Tipper Gore, the wife of Al Gore, who was then a United States senator, when she heard her daughter listening to it, helping lead to the formation of the Parents’ Music Resource Center, which eventually pressured record companies into labeling albums to warn of “explicit content. ” Prince himself would later, in a more religious phase, decide not to use profanities onstage, but his songs  —   like his 2013 single “Breakfast Can Wait”  —   never renounced carnal delights. Prince didn’t try to repeat the blockbuster sound of “Purple Rain,” and for a time he withdrew from performing. He toyed with pastoral, psychedelic elements on “Around the World in a Day” in 1985, which included the hit “Raspberry Beret,” and “Parade” in 1986, which was the soundtrack for a movie he wrote and directed, “Under the Cherry Moon,” that was an awkward flop. He also built his studio complex, Paisley Park, in the   for a reported $10 million, and in 1989 his “Batman” soundtrack album sold two million copies. Friction grew in the 1990s between Prince and his label, Warner Bros. over the size of his output and how much music he was determined to release. “Sign O’ the Times,” a monumental 1987 album that addressed politics and religion as well as romance, was a   set, cut back from a triple. By the   Prince was in open battle with the label, releasing albums as rapidly as he could to finish his contract quality suffered and so did sales. He appeared with the word “Slave” written on his face, complaining about the terms of his contract, and in 1993 he changed his stage name to an unpronounceable glyph, only returning to Prince in 1996 after the Warner contract ended. He marked the change with a triple album, independently released on his own NPG label: “Emancipation. ” For the next two decades, Prince put out an avalanche of recordings.  ’s takeover of RB meant that he was heard far less often on the radio his last Top 10 hit was “The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,” in 1994. He experimented early with online sales and distribution of his music, but eventually turned against what he saw as technology companies’ exploitation of the musician instead, he tried other forms of distribution, like giving his 2007 album “Planet Earth” away with copies of The Daily Mail in Britain. His catalog is not available on the streaming service Spotify, and he took extensive legal measures against users of his music on YouTube and elsewhere. But Prince could always draw and satisfy a live audience, and concerts easily sustained his later career. He was an indefatigable performer: posing, dancing, taking a turn at every instrument, teasing a crowd and then dazzling it. He defied a downpour to play a triumphal “Purple Rain” at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2007, and he headlined the Coachella festival in 2008 for a reported $5 million. A succession of his bands  —   the Revolution, the New Power Generation, 3rdEyeGirl  —   were united by their funky momentum and quick reflexes as Prince made every show seem both thoroughly rehearsed and improvisational. His survivors include a sister, Tyka Nelson, and several  . His marriages to Mayte Garcia and Manuela Testolini ended in divorce. A trove of Prince’s recordings remains unreleased, in an archive he called the Vault. Like much of his offstage career, its contents are a closely guarded secret, but it’s likely that there are masterpieces yet to be heard.",0
67506,"With Help From an Error, the Blue Jays Sweep the Rangers and Advance - The New York Times","TORONTO  —   It was not an obvious moment of infamy  —   no ground ball through the legs, no fastball down the middle just begging to be a hit. But the record will show that the play that sent the Toronto Blue Jays to the American League Championship Series on Sunday was scored as an error against the most notorious member of the Texas Rangers. Second baseman Rougned Odor, who punched the Blue Jays’ Jose Bautista in the jaw in May, made a wild throw while trying to turn a double play in the bottom of the 10th inning at Rogers Centre in Game 3 of this division series. Josh Donaldson, who had led off with a double, slid headfirst into home to complete a   victory and a     sweep. Odor’s error was the first in baseball history to end a postseason series. “I threw it a little bit to the side,” he said. “I pulled the ball a little bit. I tried to do my best, and that’s it. I had a chance at first. If it was a good throw, we can make the double play. ” Toronto returns to the A. L. C. S. after having lost in six games to the Kansas City Royals last fall. The series starts Friday in Boston or Cleveland the Indians can eliminate the Red Sox at Fenway Park on Monday to finish a sweep of that series. The Blue Jays emphatically stomped the Rangers, who had the A. L.’s best record but fell to Toronto in the division series for the second year in a row. The Rangers hit . 204 and posted a 6. 18 earned run average. “We got cold at the worst moment,” said Adrian Beltre, the veteran Texas third baseman. “We’re facing a team that got hot, and we couldn’t find a way to beat them. ” Bautista  —   whose bat flip in last year’s division series angered the Rangers  —   had a chance to win the series against Matt Bush, the reliever who plunked him in May before Bautista’s hard slide led to Odor’s punch. But after Donaldson’s double and an intentional walk to Edwin Encarnacion, Bush struck out Bautista to bring up Russell Martin. Martin saw eight pitches, all fastballs from 97 to 99 miles per hour. After two   fouls, he lashed a grounder to the shortstop hole, where Elvis Andrus backhanded it and flipped it to Odor, who was covering second base. Encarnacion slid into second, but Odor said that did not affect him. Still, he fired a   throw into the dirt that pulled Mitch Moreland off first base. The ball skipped off the glove of Moreland, who scrambled to pick it up and fling it home, but too late. “If it gets past me, we have no shot,” Moreland said. “I knew I had to knock it down and try to keep it close. It just got a little too far from me. ” Moreland said that if the ball had stayed in his glove, or fallen right at his feet, he doubted that Donaldson would have even tried for home. But when the ball got away, the   Moreland had to set his feet as he gathered it, emboldening Donaldson to make his dash. “What’s kind of crazy is, I played against Mitch Moreland for a long time and played against him in college as well,” said Donaldson, who attended Auburn when Moreland played for Mississippi State. “So it wasn’t one of those situations where I was just wheeling around third to score, because I respect Mitch’s arm. For me, the deciding factor was once I saw the ball get away from him, I felt like I had to take a chance. That situation in the game, if he ends up throwing me out, making a great play, you kind of have to tip your cap to him. But I’m banking on the fact that I’m going to make it more times than not. ” The Rangers’ last hope was a replay review to examine whether Encarnacion’s slide could be considered interference. Although the Blue Jays paused their reveling for a moment, the umpire crew chief, Joe West, soon removed his headset and gently signaled safe. “It was a little bit of a buzzkill,” Martin said, but the Blue Jays were not complaining. Just five days after celebrating a thriller against Baltimore in the   game  —   which was won on an Encarnacion homer in the 11th  —   the Blue Jays partied in their clubhouse again. Toronto did not secure a   berth until the final day of the regular season, struggling at times with inconsistent offense despite a sturdy pitching staff. But the team has won six games in a row to clinch a playoff spot and advance through two rounds. The Blue Jays mauled the Rangers’ star pitchers, Cole Hamels and Yu Darvish, to win the first two games by a combined  . “Even when people around them doubted, the belief was here  —   we’re going to play well and we’re going to be a championship team,” said Mark Shapiro, the Blue Jays’ president and chief executive. “We’ve had isolated moments, but this is probably the best baseball we’ve played all year  —   at the right time. ” There was no misbehavior on Sunday, no beanballs or punches or beer cans flung from the stands. After a fan just missed hitting Orioles outfielder Hyun Soo Kim with a beer can on Tuesday, the Blue Jays announced they would serve beer only in plastic cups for the rest of the postseason. And the teams made good on their promise to leave behind their tense history and play clean. “We kind of put our emotions aside and played good baseball,” Martin said. Some Rangers fans chanted Odor’s name at Bautista when he batted at their park, and most Blue Jays fans vigorously booed Odor whenever he was announced Sunday. But Odor said that did not bother him. “I’ve been playing like this in my country,” said Odor, who has played winter ball in his native Venezuela. “We have really good fans in Venezuela and I play with one of the best teams in Venezuela. It’s always a lot of people, a lot of crowds. I’ve been in that situation before. ” The Rangers have been in this situation before, too, hurting themselves in a   playoff game in Toronto. Last year while leading in the seventh inning of the decisive fifth game, Texas fell apart thanks to two errors by Andrus and another by Moreland. Andrus, 28 and also from Venezuela, said he consoled Odor, who is 22, after the game. Odor said he appreciated the support. “I was the one making errors last year,” Andrus said. “I know how it feels. It’s the worst feeling ever. But we still have a lot of years in our career. Sooner or later, we’re going to be back in the playoffs, and hopefully we can go deeper. ” The Rangers made other mistakes in Game 3: Two misplaced sliders by Colby Lewis turned into homers for Encarnacion and Martin in the first inning, and a passed ball by catcher Jonathan Lucroy brought in the tying run in the sixth. Texas briefly held two leads, and Andrus and Odor homered off Aaron Sanchez, who gave up six runs and walked four over five and   innings. But the Rangers were nearly helpless against the Blue Jays’ bullpen. Moreland greeted Joe Biagini with a double in the sixth, but Biagini and three others retired the final 13 Texas hitters. Roberto Osuna worked the last two innings for Toronto, earning the victory after securing a   save in Game 2. Now Osuna and his teammates get four days to rest before the A. L. C. S. Donaldson has been playing hurt, without disclosing the injury. It is safe to say he felt just fine diving into the next round. “When you have 50, 000 fans screaming,” Donaldson said, “it kind of numbs the pain. ”",0
34382,Anthony Weiner checks into sex addiction rehab clinic: Daily Mail,"(Reuters) - Disgraced former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner has checked into a rehab facility that treats sex addiction, the DailyMail.com reported on Wednesday. The online version of the British newspaper said electronic devices are banned at the facility, which separates men from women and treats a range of addictions related to cyber sex, exhibitionism and anonymous sex and other acts. The facility was not named in the report. Reuters could not independently verify the report. Weiner could not be reached for comment. Federal prosecutors and New York police announced last month they were investigating Weiner following a separate report by the DailyMail.com that he engaged in sexually explicit cellphone and online messages with a 15-year-old girl from North Carolina. Weiner, 52, did not respond at the time to Reuters’ requests for comment on the texting report but told the Associated Press last month that he had “likely been the subject of a hoax.” An investigation into those messages also triggered a new FBI probe of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s emails, as some of her emails were found on a device related to the Weiner investigation, sources close to the matter said. Once a popular congressman, Weiner resigned in 2011 after saying he had accidentally sent a lewd picture over Twitter. Two years later, his campaign for New York City mayor was derailed after explicit photos he had sent under the pseudonym “Carlos Danger” to a young woman in Indiana surfaced. Weiner’s wife, Huma Abedin, one of Clinton’s top aides, said in August she was separating from her husband after yet another scandal. Abedin’s announcement followed a New York Post report that Weiner had recently sent photos of his boxer-brief-clad genitals – one while he was in bed with their toddler son – via Twitter to another woman. An attorney for Abedin could not be reached on Wednesday to comment on the DailyMail.com report. ",0
65475,"Trump supporters see Iraqi, Syrian refugees as major threat: report","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Supporters of Donald Trump, the presumptive U.S. Republican presidential nominee, see refugees arriving from Iraq and Syria as one of the greatest threats to the United States, according to a study released on Thursday by the Pew Research Center. Eighty-five percent of respondents who said they supported Trump saw the refugees fleeing the Islamic State militant group as a threat, compared with 74 percent of Republicans overall, said the study. Only 40 percent of Democrats viewed the refugees from the region as a major threat.  Trump’s campaign said in a statement last December that he was “calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” His comments followed fatal attacks in Paris claimed by Islamic State and a deadly shooting spree in San Bernardino, California, by a Muslim couple who the FBI said had been radicalized. U.S. President Barack Obama’s promise to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the year has sparked a backlash from Republicans, concerned that violent militants could come into the United States posing as refugees. More than 30 governors have tried to block refugees from their states. There are nearly 5 million registered Syrian refugees according to the United Nations, a result of a war in which more than 250,000 people have been killed.  The Pew report, based mostly on telephone interviews with about 2,000 U.S. adults from April 12 to 19, found that 65 percent of Trump supporters also saw the U.S. involvement in the global economy in a negative light. There were also contradictions among Americans when asked about U.S. defense spending and foreign military action. Although 35 percent of all respondents said they were in support of increasing defense spending, the highest level of support since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, almost 60 percent said other countries should deal with their own problems.  Respondents overall saw Islamic State as the top foreign policy concern, followed by cyber attacks and global economic instability, according to the report.  ",0
15032,Apple Removes New York Times Apps From Its Store in China - The New York Times,"Apple, complying with what it said was a request from Chinese authorities, removed news apps created by The New York Times from its app store in China late last month. The move limits access to one of the few remaining channels for readers in mainland China to read The Times without resorting to special software. The government began blocking The Times’s websites in 2012, after a series of articles on the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, who was then prime minister, but it had struggled in recent months to prevent readers from using the   app. Apple removed both the   and   apps from the app store in China on Dec. 23. Apps from other international publications, including The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal, were still available in the app store. “For some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations,” Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, said of the Times apps. “As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China. ” Mr. Sainz declined to comment on what local regulations the Times apps were said to have violated, who had contacted Apple and when, and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented. China’s main internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, did not respond to faxed questions. The Times bureau in Beijing said it had not been contacted by the Chinese government about the matter. A Times spokeswoman in New York, Eileen Murphy, said the company had asked Apple to reconsider its decision. “The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country, coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world,” Ms. Murphy said in a statement. The request appears to have been made under regulations released in June 2016 called Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Services. The regulations say apps cannot “engage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security, disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others. ” The cyberspace administration says on its website that apps also cannot publish “prohibited” information. The ruling Communist Party tightly controls media inside China and employs one of the world’s most sophisticated systems of internet censorship. Chinese law prohibits the publication of “harmful information” online, and officials often take action without legal procedures or court orders against material they deem objectionable. Apple has previously removed other, less prominent media apps from its China store. It is unclear how the company evaluates requests from Beijing to take down apps and whether it ever resists them. Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has said that the company complies with all local laws. While in early 2016 Apple resisted a court request in the United States for it to help federal officials unlock an iPhone for a criminal investigation, Mr. Cook said he would obey whatever order the court ultimately handed down. In the end, the government was able to unlock the device without Apple’’s help and the case was dropped. Farzana Aslam, associate director of the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, noted that in matters involving customer privacy, Apple requires governments to submit subpoenas, search warrants or other legal documents. “Maybe in the end they have to do it, but I think there’s something to be said about standing up for what you believe in and purporting to put principle before profit in a country like China, to show that actually there is this tension there,” Ms. Aslam said. “It’s not as simple as, ‘Because we operate in your jurisdiction, we’ll do anything you ask of us. ’” She added that it was “very worrying” that Apple had not disclosed what laws the authorities said were violated, making it difficult for The Times and other publishers to file an appeal or challenge the government’s requests. In the weeks leading up to the withdrawal of the Times apps, The Times was working on various articles related to the Chinese government. One of them, posted online on Dec. 29, revealed the billions of dollars in hidden perks and subsidies that the Chinese government provides to the world’s biggest iPhone factory. China is also one of Apple’s largest iPhone markets, though sales in that region have slowed. On Dec. 23, David Barboza, a Times reporter, spoke with members of Apple’s media team about the article. Mr. Barboza had previously been in touch with the iPhone factory owner, Foxconn. He had also contacted the Chinese government as part of his reporting. Later that day, a separate team from Apple informed The Times that the apps would be removed, Ms. Murphy said. In another article, published on Dec. 22 as a post on its Sinosphere blog, The Times described an   internet video that had been widely promoted by Chinese public security offices. The Times news apps remain available in Apple’s app stores for other countries, as well as the Hong Kong and Taiwan stores, but people must have a credit card with a billing address outside mainland China to download them. The Times crossword puzzle and virtual reality apps remain available throughout China. When the Chinese government began blocking the Times websites in 2012, it also prevented users with Times apps from downloading new content. But readers in China can still gain access to The Times using software that circumvents the government’s firewall. And in July 2015, The Times released a new version of its   app that adopted a different method for retrieving articles, one that the government appeared unable to stop. Apple’s decision to remove the app from its China store should not affect those who have already installed it. But users in China will not be able to download new releases unless they use another region’s app store. The Times discovered after being blocked in 2012 that hackers with possible ties to the Chinese military had targeted the newspaper’s computer systems and that the attacks coincided with the reporting for that Times investigation. Foreign tech companies face increasing pressure from government authorities in China. In April, Apple’s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in the country, just six months after they were introduced there.
