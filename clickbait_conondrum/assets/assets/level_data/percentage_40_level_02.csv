55447,Leaders Applaud Gorsuch Confirmation as ‚ÄôWin for Pro-Life Movement‚Äô,"National   leaders are celebrating the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court as a huge ‚Äúwin for the   movement. ‚Äù[The Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) is featuring a photo of President Donald Trump‚Äôs letter to   leaders, expressing his gratitude for their efforts to confirm Gorsuch to the Supreme Court:  Here‚Äôs the letter @POTUS sent us thanking Susan B. Anthony List members for taking action to #ConfirmGorsuch #ProLife pic. twitter.   ‚Äî   Susan B Anthony List (@SBAList) April 7, 2017,  Congratulations to our new Supreme Court justice, Neil Gorsuch  thank you @POTUS for nominating him! #ProLife #ConfirmGorsuch üéâüéàüçæ pic. twitter.   ‚Äî   Susan B Anthony List (@SBAList) April 7, 2017,  The Senate‚Äôs vote to confirm Gorsuch comes one day after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved to change the procedural rules of the chamber and end the Democrats‚Äô filibuster of Trump‚Äôs nominee. ‚ÄúThe swift fulfillment of President Trump‚Äôs commitment to appoint   Supreme Court justices is a tremendous win for the   movement,‚Äù said SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser in a statement. ‚ÄúSusan B. Anthony List has been rallying the   grassroots behind Judge Gorsuch‚Äôs nomination for months, including rallies in seven states where   came out in force to urge their Senators to confirm Gorsuch. ‚Äù Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, also applauds Gorsuch‚Äôs confirmation: We were pleased to support Judge Gorsuch‚Äôs nomination, as were our grassroots activists from across America who sent thousands of messages to their Senators in support of his nomination. We thank Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for remaining steadfast throughout this process and President Trump for keeping his promise to the American people in nominating a   Justice to the Supreme Court. ‚ÄùThe March for Life congratulates Judge Neil #Gorsuch on his historic confirmation to the Supreme Court today.‚Äù https:  .   ‚Äî   March for Life (@March_for_Life) April 7, 2017,  In exit poll reporting in November, CNN observed that 70 percent of voters said appointments to the Supreme Court were important to their vote, with 56 percent of Trump voters stating they were the most important factor. Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, also hailed the Senate‚Äôs vote to confirm Gorsuch. ‚ÄúJudge Gorsuch‚Äôs confirmation is Exhibit A for the argument that advocates for life and religious liberty need to vote,‚Äù said Pavone. ‚ÄúWithout the active participation of social conservatives in last year‚Äôs elections, today we would be looking at a Supreme Court dominated by extreme   justices. Instead, there‚Äôs great hope for the future. ‚Äù Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said the Supreme Court vacancy after the sudden death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia ‚Äúbecame a defining issue of the 2016 presidential election. ‚Äù ‚ÄúPresident Trump made history by telling voters who he would appoint to the Court by providing a list  ‚Äî   the American people chose him and he in turn chose from the list, keeping his promise,‚Äù Perkins added. Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said Gorsuch‚Äôs confirmation is ‚Äúa huge win for the Trump administration and for the   movement. ‚Äù ‚ÄúStudents for Life commends President Trump for keeping his promise to appoint a judge in the mold of the late Justice Scalia, and we look forward to the day when abortion on demand, in all nine months of pregnancy is no longer the law of the land,‚Äù she said. Maureen Ferguson, senior policy adviser with The Catholic Association, said Gorsuch‚Äôs confirmation will help to correct the ‚Äúalarming erosion‚Äù of the First Amendment right to practice one‚Äôs faith without discrimination. ‚ÄúSenate Republicans have restored the true tradition of confirming justices without filibusters and the   of recent years,‚Äù she added.",0
46638,"Norway's Merkel, Erna Solberg hopes to beat history in re-election bid","OSLO (Reuters) - Erna Solberg seeks to accomplish something no Conservative Norwegian prime minister has managed for more than three decades: winning a second term. If Norwegians are sufficiently happy with Solberg s last four years in power, they will re-elect her on Sept. 11; if not she will lose to Labour Party leader Jonas Gahr Stoere. Opinion polls show the race is too close to call. Solberg hopes to emulate a European center-right leader with an enviable track record of winning: Angela Merkel, herself seeking a fourth term as Germany s chancellor.  She is absolutely the most important politician in Europe,  Solberg said after taking office in 2013 as she prepared for her first foreign trip as prime minister, to Berlin. Portraying herself as a steady figure who steered western Europe s top oil and gas producer through a two-year slump in energy prices, Solberg has warned voters her defeat would mean a  red-green chaos  of socialists and environmentalists bent on raising taxes. Once known as  Iron Erna  for her tough stance on immigration, Solberg softened her image and broadened her appeal with a 2011 book emphasizing people s needs over the Conservative Party s traditional focus on fiscal prudence. Conservatives hope to capitalize on an easy-going personality that has made Solberg popular beyond her party, as seen in a Sept. 6 poll where 46.3 percent believed her best suited to be prime minister, against Stoere s 39.1 percent. (For a graphic on Norway's parliamentary elections click tmsnrt.rs/2ugJCjo)  There is an enormous focus on her as a person, which has given the party a real boost during the election campaign,  said Associate Professor Tore Bang at BI Norwegian Business School, an expert in public relations and political communication.  The hype around her is atypical for a leader of the Conservative Party. She is seen as a much more folksy politician and has a much broader appeal than Gahr Stoere.  Born on Feb. 24, 1961, in her late teens Solberg was diagnosed with dyslexia. Graduating in political science she was elected to parliament aged 28, becoming deputy party leader in 2002 before taking the top job in 2004. She is Norway s second female prime minister after Labour s Gro Harlem Brundtland, who led three governments in the 80s and early 90s and became known as  the mother of the nation .  As prime minister, Solberg has really strengthened her position as an uncontested party leader. She personifies the party brand and the association between her and the party is comparable to what Gro Harlem Brundtland had in the Labour Party,  said Bang of the BI Norwegian Business School. While the opposition was long favored to win, opinion polls show Solberg and her allies have closed the gap in recent months, taking advantage of an economic rebound.  It s quite apparent that the Conservative Party has looked to Germany and found inspiration in the position Merkel has taken there,  said Johannes Bergh, head researcher of the University of Oslo s National Election Studies program.  It s a comparison that the party really likes. Merkel is very good at winning elections and offers a lot of the same things as Solberg.  The economic upturn, and concerns it could falter, will play well for the prime minister, Bergh said.  The backdrop of this election is that the Norwegian economy is doing well again. There is no real sense of crisis anymore but people are still weary, so offering a stable and predictable Merkel-like leadership is a strategy that seems to have worked well.   If she wins, she plans to continue a policy of cutting taxes on companies and individuals, but her room for maneuver will be tighter as Norway s near-trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund is not expected to grow as the same pace as before. In Norway s fragmented parliament however, where nine parties are expected to win seats, re-election will not guarantee a Solberg government survives another four years. Kaare Willoch, the last Conservative prime minister to win back-to-back elections, in 1981 and 1985, was booted out of office just months into his second term in a disagreement over petrol taxes. In fact, if she were to serve two full terms, Solberg would easily become the longest-serving Conservative prime minister since the introduction of the parliamentary system in the late 19th century.

17417,Republican healthcare bill imperiled with 22 million seen losing insurance,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Twenty-two million Americans would lose insurance over the next decade under the U.S. Senate Republican healthcare bill, a nonpartisan congressional office said on Monday, complicating the path forward for the already-fraught legislation. After the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score, Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, said she could not support moving forward on the bill as written. Collins‚Äô opposition highlights the delicate balance that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must strike as he tries to deliver a legislative win to President Donald Trump by reconciling the Republican Party‚Äôs moderate and conservative wings. Moderate senators are concerned about millions of people losing insurance. Key conservative senators have said the Senate bill does not do enough to repeal Obamacare. The CBO assessment that an additional 15 million people would be uninsured in 2018 under the bill and its prediction that insurance premiums would skyrocket over the first two years prompted concern from both sides.  McConnell‚Äôs goal was to have a vote on the bill before the July 4 recess that starts at the end of this week. But several Republicans, including Collins, have said they would not approve a procedural motion that would clear the way for a vote. McConnell can afford to lose just two Republican senators from their 52-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate, which would allow passage of the bill with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote.   ‚ÄúIf you are on the fence ... this CBO score didn‚Äôt help you, so I think it‚Äôs going to be harder to get to 50, not easier,‚Äù Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said of the bill‚Äôs prospects. The CBO score is also likely to amplify criticism from industry groups such as the American Medical Association, which said earlier on Monday that the Senate‚Äôs bill violated the doctors‚Äô precept of ‚Äúfirst, do no harm.‚Äù The CBO is only able to assess the impact of legislation within a 10-year window, but it said that insurance losses are expected to grow beyond 22 million due to deep cuts to the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled that are not scheduled to go into effect until 2025.  Trump and Republicans in Congress made repealing and replacing Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama‚Äôs signature domestic legislation, a central campaign promise. The pressure is on for them to deliver now that they control the White House, House of Representatives and Senate. Republicans view Obamacare as costly government intrusion and say that individual insurance markets are collapsing. Obamacare expanded health coverage to some 20 million Americans by expanding Medicaid and mandating that individuals obtain health insurance. The CBO score was released just hours after Republicans revised the bill, adding a measure that would penalize people who let their insurance coverage lapse for an extended period. The move followed criticism that the original bill would result in a sicker - and more expensive - insurance pool.  At least four conservative Republicans - Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ron Johnson and Mike Lee - have expressed opposition to the Senate legislation.    Moderate Republicans have warned against replacing Obamacare with legislation that is too similar to the version passed by the House, saying it would cause too many people, especially those with low incomes, to lose health coverage. The CBO estimated that the House bill would cause 23 million people to lose insurance. Trump had called the House bill ‚Äúmean‚Äù and asked Senate Republicans to come up with ‚Äúmore generous‚Äù legislation. Democrats uniformly oppose both the House and Senate versions of the bill. ‚ÄúCBO‚Äôs report today makes clear that this bill is every bit as ‚Äòmean as the House bill,‚Äù Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, told reporters. The White House in a statement on Monday criticized the CBO for issuing a ‚Äúflawed report‚Äù and said its assessments should not be ‚Äútrusted blindly.‚Äù Trump and McConnell have been working to shore up support. The president called key conservative senators over the weekend, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.  Both Cruz and Johnson said they were concerned about CBO estimates that insurance premiums would initially rise as much as 30 percent over the first two years before declining. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt help the people whose premiums skyrocket next year,‚Äù Cruz told reporters. ‚ÄúKind of a problem, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Johnson said of the short-term premium increase. Johnson and Paul have said they will oppose the procedural motion that would allow the Senate to move forward to a vote. Cruz is drafting suggested fixes. Paul remains opposed to the bill.     The first moderate Republican to oppose the bill, Senator Dean Heller, is already facing political fallout. America First Policies, a political group run by former Trump campaign staffers, said it would air healthcare-related attack ads against Heller, who faces a competitive re-election race in Nevada next year. Senator Rob Portman, of Ohio, who has not said whether he supports the bill, was ‚Äúdressed down‚Äù by McConnell during a Monday leadership meeting, a senior Republican aide told Reuters.  Ohio participates in Obamacare‚Äôs Medicaid expansion, and Republican Governor John Kasich has criticized the Senate bill. Portman‚Äôs office did not respond to a request to comment. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said his governor, fellow Republican Rick Scott, would be on Capitol Hill this week to discuss the bill‚Äôs impact on the state. Constituent and industry groups have been critical of the Senate bill‚Äôs proposal to reduce the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and point to the CBO analysis that it would disproportionately affect older adults. Under Senate rules, the bill must replicate savings projected in the House version that passed last month. It cleared that critical hurdle, with the CBO estimating it would decrease the budget deficit by $321 billion over 2017-2026. A revision to the bill that imposes a penalty for prolonged lapses in insurance coverage addresses the original bill‚Äôs provision to drop the Obamacare penalty on those who do not have insurance. Experts had warned that canceling the fine could lead to a sicker insurance pool because young and healthy people would not face consequences for failing to purchase insurance.  The bill would impose a six-month waiting period for anyone who lets their health insurance lapse for over 63 days and then wants to re-enroll in a plan in the individual market. The 15 million people the CBO estimates would be uninsured in 2018 is largely due to the repeal of the penalty associated with being uninsured. The CBO did not evaluate the revised version that included the new waiting period. Insurer Blue Cross and Blue Shield said it was encouraged by the inclusion of incentives for continuous coverage. Molina Healthcare said it preferred the Obamacare mandate, said that and the Senate bill, even after revised, would simply delay care. If the Senate passes a bill, it will either have to be approved by the House, the two chambers would have to reconcile their differences in a conference committee, or the House could pass a new version and bounce it back to the Senate.

23416,Obama warns Trump not to spread details of security briefings,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama confirmed on Thursday that Donald Trump will get national security briefings ahead of the November election, but he warned the Republican candidate, whom he has called ‚Äúunfit‚Äù for office, that information from the meetings must be kept secret. Obama, a Democrat who endorsed his former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 White House race, has made clear his dismay over Trump, a New York businessman who has proposed temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States and building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. On Tuesday Obama questioned why leading Republicans have not withdrawn their support for their presidential nominee. On Thursday he dismissed as ridiculous Trump‚Äôs claims that the election may be rigged. ‚ÄúOf course the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean?‚Äù Obama said with exasperation. ‚ÄúIf Mr. Trump is up 10 or 15 points on Election Day and ends up losing, then maybe he can raise some questions. That doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case at the moment.‚Äù Trump is trailing Clinton in polls. Despite his disdain, Obama said Trump would get the top secret briefings on world crises and security threats to which he, Clinton and their respective vice presidential running mates are entitled. Some Republicans have said Clinton should be denied access to such briefings because of her handling of classified material on a private email server while she was secretary of state.  Obama on Thursday, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, made clear that both candidates would be treated equally. ‚ÄúWe are going to go by the law, which is that, in both tradition and the law, that if somebody is the nominee ... they need to get a security briefing so that if they were to win, they are not starting from scratch in terms of being prepared,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúWhat I will say is that they have been told these are classified briefings,‚Äù he added, in response to a question about whether he was concerned about Trump obtaining the classified information. ‚ÄúAnd if they want to be president, they got to start acting like president, and that means being able to receive these briefings and not spread them around.‚Äù Trump has placed blame on Clinton and Obama for the rise of Islamic State, also known as ISIS. ‚ÄúThe Obama-Clinton foreign policy gave rise to ISIS, made Iran flush with cash, and is now admitting vast numbers of refugees and migrants into the United States from some of the most volatile regions in the world,‚Äù Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said in a statement. ‚ÄúBut none of this is surprising from an Administration that allowed its Secretary of State to threaten the country with a private email server, delete her records, and lie about it to us all,‚Äù Miller said. Obama, who was meeting with his national security advisers about the fight against Islamic State, also made a subtle jab at Trump for his dispute with a Muslim couple whose U.S. Army captain son died in Iraq. Obama lauded ‚Äúpatriotic Muslim Americans‚Äù who fight in the U.S. armed forces. ",0
9378,PressTV-‚ÄòClintons worked with US enemies‚Äô,"Interviews The FBI probe was inevitable ‚Äúbecause of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the Clinton Foundation had, most specifically and grievously to Saudi Arabia, to Qatar,‚Äù says American analyst Scott Bennett. 
The ongoing federal investigation into the Clinton Foundation was expected because of the Clinton family‚Äôs ties with US enemies, says Scott Bennett, a former US Army psychological warfare officer. 
The FBI has been probing possible pay-to-play schemes at the family foundation for over a year now and is ‚Äúlikely‚Äù to press charges against it, Fox News reported Wednesday, citing informed officials. 
Bennett told Press TV on Friday that the probe was inevitable ‚Äúbecause of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the Clinton Foundation had, most specifically and grievously to Saudi Arabia, to Qatar,‚Äù and many other countries blacklisted by Washington. 
It was revealed on Friday that the Clinton Foundation took a $1 million gift from Qatar during Hillary Clinton‚Äôs tenure as the US secretary of state, without her informing the State Department. 
Hillary decided to not inform the department of the transaction, despite signing an ethics agreement with regards to the foundation when she became secretary of state. 
According to the foundation‚Äôs website, Qatar has so far given the Clintons a total of between $1 million and $5 million over the years. 
Aside from Qatar, Saudi Arabia has also been one of the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs biggest donors. It became known in 2008 that the kingdom had given them between $10 million and $25 million. 
‚ÄúSo those terrorist entities, which have been labeled as the enemies of the United States, have been appearing as Clinton Foundation donors,‚Äù Bennett said. 
‚ÄúThat is a serious crime, it is treason, it is corruption, it is bribery of officials,‚Äù said the analyst. 
Bennett argued that all the leaks and investigations concerning the Clinton family were coming from ‚Äúthose personnel in the American government who have had enough.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThey have stepped up, they have released emails, they have hacked into their own computers and in some cases they have provided it to WikiLeaks,‚Äù he added. 
Whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks has released thousands of Hillary‚Äôs campaign chairman and top aide John Podesta‚Äôs emails since last month, exposing some of the well-kept secrets surrounding the Clinton family and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs bid for the White House. 
Bennett predicted that the case would ‚Äúmost probably‚Äù lead to indictments and some people would be arrested as early as this weekend. Loading ... ",1

15036, New York Times Reports There‚Äôs An Actual Russian Agent In Congress And He Has A Code Name,"More than a year ago, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was caught *oops* on a hot mic saying that there were two people in Washington who were being paid by the Russians   Donald Trump and California GOP. Rep Dana Rohrabacher. Sadly, those two people are still in office.A new report by the New York Times, though, confirms half of McCarthy s comments. Rohrabacher isn t just being paid by the Russians, he s a Russian agent, and he has a code name, and it s not even new information.According to the Times report, the FBI warned Rohrbacher in 2012 that the Russians viewed him as a source and had given him a code name. The next year, Congress elevated him to the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee that overseas Russian policy. Nope, nothing at all fishy there.Rohrabacher didn t seem to have much involvement in the Trump campaign (that would be too obvious, even for the Russians), but Special Investigator Robert Mueller is eyeing him nonetheless:As revelations of Russia s campaign to influence American politics consume Washington, Mr. Rohrabacher, 70, who had no known role in the Trump election campaign, has come under political and investigative scrutiny. The F.B.I. and the Senate Intelligence Committee are each seeking to interview him about an August meeting with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, Mr. Rohrabacher said. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is said to be interested in a meeting he had last year with Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump s short-lived national security adviser.Rohrabacher s Russian connections go back further than just a few years, though. As a young Reaganite, he got the warm fuzzies with the fall of the Soviet Union and he developed a relationship with Vladimir Putin. In the 90s, Rohrabacher lost an arm wrestling match to the man who would become President for life, or whatever the hell Putin calls himself.Rohrabacher, naturally, denies that he is a Russian agent:Mr. Rohrabacher has laughed off suggestions that he is a Russian asset, and said in an interview that he did not remember being briefed that the Russians viewed him as a source. The F.B.I. and the senior members of the House Intelligence Committee sat Mr. Rohrabacher down in the Capitol in 2012 to warn him that Russian spies were trying to recruit him, according to two former intelligence officials. I remember them telling me,  You have been targeted to be recruited as an agent,  he said.  How stupid is that? Only, his actions paint a very different picture. In 2016, he served as what might be called a delivery boy between Russia and either the Trump campaign or the RNC. He picked up a memo targeting Democratic donors. Rohrabacher has also met with Wikileaks  Julian Assange and Russian (accused criminal) oligarchs.Rohrabacher insists nothing untoward is going on. His goal, he says, is to bring Russia in to help us battle terrorism. To be fair, Russia could help rein in terrorism, but they would have to stop funding terrorists, like Syrian President Bashir Assad.Republicans are finding it a bit easier to distance themselves from Rohrabacher than the other alleged Russian agent, Donald Trump. They are limiting his power on the Foreign Affairs committee.Politically, this could be disaster for Rohrabacher. He s facing a tough race in California, and you d better believe that his opponents are using his Russian connections against him.Hans Keirstead, a prominent stem-cell researcher competing with five other Democrats to challenge Mr. Rohrabacher, compared the Republican s Russia record to  a prologue to a very bad book. We ve got a Russian-tainted congressman,  Mr. Keirstead said in an interview, adding  Why should the constituents of the 48th District vote for an individual whose interests are elsewhere? Of course, Rohrabacher, like anyone who s been trained in dictator 101, is fundraising off of it, calling it an  attack. Featured image via Adam Berry/Getty Images.",1
49873," House Republicans Just Went After Your Retirement Savings, And They Want To Give It To Wall Street (VIDEO)","On Thursday Republicans in Congress voted to overturn a rule, proposed by the Obama administration, which requires investment advisers to act in the best interest of the person they are advising.The rule was first proposed last year, after a detailed report from Senator Elizabeth Warren revealed that financial advisers are receiving a treasure trove of incentives, kickbacks and non-cash awards for giving out bad financial advice to seniors and people on the brink of retirement.As Addicting Info reported here, Warren s report showed that financial advisers are rewarded with all-expenses-paid, luxury vacations to places like South Africa, the Bahamas and Aruba, as well as golf outings, theater tickets, gift cards and cash prizes, all for steering retirees toward risky, company-owned investment options.While financial advisors personally profit from doling out bad advice, retirees lose more than $17 billion a year because of a loophole that leaves them unprotected under traditional conflict of interest laws.The Obama administration has been working to fix the loophole by including people who seek advice about pension and retirement accounts as people toward whom advisers have a  fiduciary obligation,  under the conflict of interest law.In the meantime, the industry has been fighting hard to keep the rule from taking effect.During a hearing on the proposed rule last year, Senator Elizabeth Warren went head-to-head with the President of Primerica, Peter Schneider, who was brought in to testify against the rule.Watch Senator Warren hammer away at Schneider in the video below, courtesy of Sweet Videos on YouTube:While it s clear from Senator Warren s report and the testimony in the video above that the rule is needed to protect consumers, Republicans proved yet again that they have no desire to serve the interests of the public.Congress introduced and passed H.J.Res.88, which reads as follows:This joint resolution disapproves and nullifies a Department of Labor rule published on April 8, 2016, relating to the definition of the term  fiduciary  and the conflict of interest rule with respect to retirement investment advice.(The rule defines who is a fiduciary with respect to pension and retirement plans. Under current law, a person who provides investment advice has a fiduciary obligation that requires the person to provide advice in the sole interest of plan participants and beneficiaries. The rule changes the definition of  investment advice  to treat people who provide investment advice to pension and retirement plans for a fee or other compensation as fiduciaries in a wider array of advice relationships.)As much as Republicans would like him to, there s almost no chance that the President Obama would sign any bill which attacks the proposed fiduciary rule.Still, the Republican-sponsored resolution confirms what we already know about their priorities.While Democrats like President Obama and Elizabeth Warren are fighting to protect the public from Wall Street predators, Republicans are working hard to pass legislation that prevents them from doing just that.There s only one solution.

Members of the media continue to talk among themselves, as if they had not been repudiated by the people on November 8. Mass firings and new faces are needed if the media are going to have any hope of regaining any credibility with the public. 
Some on the far-left are waking up. Anis Shivani of the AlterNet news service asked , ‚ÄúIs the liberal media dead?‚Äù She answered: ‚ÄúOne of the positives of this campaign is that despite relentless 24/7 propaganda about Trump, exaggerating his personal foibles while painting anyone not supportive of Hillary as a closet misogynist, racist or even sexual predator, the message failed to get through. In the end, no one paid any attention. Those inside the elite bubble were persuaded that they were headed for victory, hearing nothing contrary in their own ecosphere, when they were in fact doomed. The people have shown that they can tune out this noise. The media has fragmented so much that only those who are already persuaded come within the ambit of any new message, so in essence they have pounded their way into their own irrelevance (emphasis added).‚Äù 
Hillary Clinton had the endorsements of most major newspapers in the United States. Her own website declared , ‚ÄúBy all accounts, this election is historic‚Äîand so is the list of newspapers from across the country endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. That list includes a number of papers that, for decades, have exclusively endorsed Republican presidential candidates‚Äîuntil now.‚Äù 
Reid Wilson of The Hill newspaper calculated that Clinton got 57 newspaper endorsements and Trump got only 2. 
In addition to The Washington Post and The New York Times, which both endorsed Hillary, some of the other notable losers included: The Columbus Dispatch endorsed a Democrat (for the first time since Woodrow Wilson), and urged voters to elect Hillary. Ohio went for Trump anyway. The Akron Beacon said that Hillary was the change this country needed. The Cincinnati Enquirer broke a century-old tradition to endorse Hillary. The Sun Sentinel editorial board urged Floridians to vote for Hillary. Florida went for Trump. The Arizona Republic broke a 120-year tradition to endorse Hillary. Arizona went for Trump. The Dallas Morning News broke a 75-year tradition of supporting Republicans to endorse Hillary. Texas went for Trump anyway. The Houston Chronicle, the largest newspaper in Texas, usually backs Republicans but endorsed Hillary. 
Among major voting blocs, one of the most amazing turnarounds can be found in the Catholic population. 
On November 2, the Catholic Jesuit publication America was reporting that Clinton was leading Trump in the polls thanks to the Catholic vote. Citing a poll from the Public Religion Research Institute and the Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies at The Catholic University of America, Clinton was getting support from 51 percent of Catholics, compared to 40 percent for Donald Trump. This is what liberal Catholics wanted to believe and encourage. Hillary‚Äôs campaign chairman John Podesta was a liberal Catholic who got a job as professor at Catholic Jesuit Georgetown University. He had communicated with other campaign officials about a scheme to force the church even further to the left. Elizabeth Yore‚Äôs article at The Remnant explained the relationship between George Soros, the Clinton campaign and the Jesuit-led Vatican. 
However, exit polls show that Trump won the Catholic vote by a margin of 52 to 45 percent. What happened? 
One answer is that Catholics are bypassing the liberal media and turning to alternative sources of news and information, such as The Remnant. Another such source is Boston Catholic Insider, which argued in an article, ‚Äú Why Catholics Should Vote for Trump ,‚Äù that Hillary had a ‚Äúmonstrous‚Äù position on abortion that justified the gruesome procedure up to and including the time of birth. 
Another growing source of news and information for Catholics and non-Catholics is LifeSite . Its post-election stories include ‚ÄúLiberal media in meltdown over Trump election‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmerica rejects Planned Parenthood and its party.‚Äù 
Another important development was the airing of the film ‚Äú A Wolf in Sheep‚Äôs Clothing ‚Äù by the EWTN Catholic cable channel. As we noted in a previous column, the film examined how Marxists have subverted the church from within by recruiting clergy into revolutionary socialist activities that divide people and cause conflict. The film was described as ‚Äúa lens into America‚Äôs cultural Marxism euphemistically called ‚Äòprogressivism.‚Äô‚Äù 
As long as the members of the liberal media continue in their old and discredited ways, without major changes in the journalism business, the alternative sources of news and information will continue to grow in power and influence. The new conservative network CRTV has just announced that Steven Crowder , from the popular show ‚ÄúLouder with Crowder,‚Äù is joining the new media venture. 
Even with major changes in the liberal media, such as the firing of liberal hacks and the hiring of solid conservatives, it is doubtful that viewership can be maintained. On outlets like CNN, they will continue to talk and act like they still have some credibility left. The public is laughing at them and declaring, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fired.‚Äù Cliff Kincaid

8628,Iraq threatens to resume military operations against Kurds,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi forces threatened on Wednesday to resume operations to capture northern Kurdish-held territory after accusing authorities there of delaying handing over control of Iraq s borders with Turkey, Iran and Syria. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Friday declared a pause in an offensive that began on Oct. 16 to take over areas claimed both by his government and the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Abadi ordered economic and military retaliation against the KRG after Iraqi Kurds voted for independence in September in a referendum that Baghdad declared illegal. He said the truce was meant to allow Iraqi troops to deploy without hindrance in the disputed areas and at the international borders. Kurdish officials said on Tuesday they were willing to allow Iraqi  oversight  at the border but said the KRG had to remain in control of crossings into the Kurdish region.  The Iraqi Joint Operations Command accused the KRG of using the talks to  buy time  in order to strengthen Kurdish lines.  During the negotiations, the (Kurdish) region was moving its forces and building new defenses,  the Iraqi statement said.  We will not allow it; the federal forces are mandated to secure (the disputed) areas and borders.  The Kurdish Peshmerga fighters  command accused Iraqi forces of massing weapons and threatening force to resolve  domestic political differences.  Iraq s entire land border with Turkey is located inside the Kurdish autonomous region, and has been controlled by the Kurds since before the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Iraqis troops on Tuesday set up positions between the Turkish and the Iraqi Kurdish checkpoints at the Habur border crossing between the Turkish town of Silopi and the Iraqi town of Zakho. That meant vehicles crossing the border were subject to three checks. Control of the border area is of crucial importance for the landlocked Kurdish region. An oil pipeline runs from northern Iraq into Turkey, carrying crude exports which are the Kurds  in principal source of funds. ",0
61173,Highlights: The Trump presidency on March 31 at 6:19 p.m. EDT,"(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration on Friday: Trump backs a decision by his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, to seek immunity in congressional investigations of possible ties between his campaign and Russia, but there is no immediate sign the request will be granted.  The Trump administration slams China on a range of trade issues from its chronic industrial overcapacity to forced technology transfers and longstanding bans on U.S. beef and electronic payment services. Beijing seeks to play down tensions with the United States and put on a positive face ahead of President Xi Jinping‚Äôs first meeting with Trump next week. Senate Democrats step closer to having enough votes to block a confirmation vote on Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court nominee with three more Democratic senators coming out against Neil Gorsuch for the lifetime job as a justice. Trump seeks to push his plan for fair trade and more manufacturing jobs back to the top of his agenda by ordering a study into the causes of U.S. trade deficits and a clampdown on import duty evasion. Trump has neither a clear White House tax plan nor adequate staff yet to see through a planned tax overhaul, according to interviews with people in the administration, in Congress and among U.S. tax experts. Democrats are trying to counter Trump‚Äôs boldest move yet to defang the U.S. consumer financial watchdog, with 40 current and former lawmakers defending the agency in court. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs scientific integrity watchdog is reviewing whether EPA chief Scott Pruitt violated the agency‚Äôs policies when he said in a television interview he does not believe carbon dioxide is driving global climate change, according to an email seen by Reuters. Trump will seek to rebuild the U.S. relationship with Egypt at a meeting on Monday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi focused on security issues and military aid, a senior White House official says. Trump will host Jordan‚Äôs King Abdullah at the White House next week to discuss the fight against Islamic State militants, the Syria crisis and advancing peace between Israelis and Palestinians, the White House says. A U.S. judge approves a $25 million settlement to resolve a class action lawsuit that claimed fraud against Trump and his Trump University real estate seminars. ",0
9459, Sean Penn TORE Steve Bannon To RIBBONS After Being Asked About About Working Together,"Sean Penn is not exactly one to mince words, and he didn t mince words when he was asked about the time he worked with Steve Bannon on a film project. Bannon has a heavy history of bankrolling and doing other work on films, even as recently as 2012. He was an executive producer for  The Indian Runner,  which was Penn s first time directing.Penn was not nice when talking about Bannon, and that s putting it mildly. He actually said: Bannon was then, as he is now, simply another bitter Hollywood wannabe who went rogue by way of toxic narcissistic iconoclasm. But, deep in his heart, he s just a conniving hateful bloated punk who despises mankind. And then there are also the bad things about him And then there are also the bad things about him  Wow. Just wow. We ve known since Bannon came into the spotlight a year ago that he was a complete dick who loves bullying people. Earlier this year, film critic Ann Hornaday wrote a piece for the Washington Post that talks about what we can learn about Bannon from watching the films he made.Many of his films are directly tied to his worldview   in fact, he s an extreme right-wing version of Michael Moore in that respect. He s spent a lot of time attacking  the permanent political class,  in his films, along with  hippies and community organizers  who allegedly hate this country and hate the Constitution. He s gone after Hillary Clinton and President Obama, but also Dick Cheney and George W. Bush. In short, he hates the whole world and everyone in it who doesn t see it exactly the way he does.Which seems to be exactly what Penn was describing in his mini-diatribe.Bannon is also someone who issues threats and ultimatums and strong-arms people into doing things his way. His narcissistic ego likely suffered a massive blow when he tried to bully Republicans on their farce of a healthcare bill by saying,  This is not a discussion. This is not a debate. You have no choice but to vote for this bill. Even before that sorry excuse of a bill failed, just the idea of Republicans not following his orders was enough for him to urge Trump to create a  shit list.  When Republicans scoffed in his general direction over his  orders,  it was very likely a humiliating defeat for him.So  he s just a conniving hateful bloated punk who despises mankind,  is a damned accurate description of him.Image of Sean Penn by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for The Hollywood Reporter.

53536,India‚Äôs Air Pollution Rivals China‚Äôs as World‚Äôs Deadliest - The New York Times,"NEW DELHI  ‚Äî   India‚Äôs rapidly worsening air pollution is causing about 1. 1 million people to die prematurely each year and is now surpassing China‚Äôs as the deadliest in the world, a new study of global air pollution shows. The number of premature deaths in China caused by dangerous air particles, known as PM2. 5, has stabilized globally in recent years but has risen sharply in India, according to the report, issued jointly on Tuesday by the Health Effects Institute, a Boston research institute focused on the health impacts of air pollution, and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, a population health research center in Seattle. India has registered an alarming increase of nearly 50 percent in premature deaths from particulate matter between 1990 and 2015, the report says. ‚ÄúYou can almost think of this as the perfect storm for India,‚Äù said Michael Brauer, a professor of environment and health relationships at the University of British Columbia and an author of the study, in a telephone interview. He cited the confluence of rapid industrialization, population growth and an aging populace in India that is more susceptible to air pollution. Pollution levels are worsening in India as it tries to industrialize, but ‚Äúthe idea that policy making should be led by government is lacking,‚Äù Bhargav Krishna, manager for environmental health at the Public Health Foundation of India, a health policy research center in New Delhi, said in an interview. As air pollution worsened in parts of the world, including South Asia, it improved in the United States and Europe, the report said, crediting policies to curb emissions, among other things. The report‚Äôs website that provides    data on pollution levels and the health and mortality effects. Environmental regulations in the United States and actions by the European Commission have led to substantial progress in reducing fine particulate pollution since 1990, the report said. The United States has experienced a reduction of about 27 percent in the average annual exposure to fine particulate matter, with smaller declines in Europe. Yet, some 88, 000 Americans and 258, 000 Europeans still face increased risks of premature death because of particulate levels today, the report said. A fraction of the width of a human hair, these particles can be released from vehicles, particularly those with diesel engines, and by industry, as well as from natural sources like dust. They enter the bloodstream through the lungs, worsening cardiac disease and increasing the risk of stroke and heart failure, in addition to causing severe respiratory problems, like asthma and pneumonia. The report offers good news globally, in some ways. Although deaths caused by air pollution grew to 4. 2 million in 2015 from 3. 5 million in 1990, the rate of increase of about 20 percent was slower than the rate of the population rise during that time. That‚Äôs because of improved health care in many parts of the world, as well as public policy initiatives undertaken in the United States, Europe and other regions that reduced emissions from industrialization, the authors of the study said in telephone interviews. China also offers an encouraging sign. Premature deaths from particulate matter each year have stabilized at around 1. 1 million since 2005, the report said. Still, that is an increase of 17 percent since 1990, when it was a little more than 945, 000. The health effects of the ultrafine particles are still being studied and the full effects are only beginning to be understood, said Majid Ezzati, a global environmental health professor at the Imperial College, London. ‚ÄúThese studies are hard to do, and isolating the effects of air pollution is hard,‚Äù Dr. Ezzati said. ‚ÄúThe numbers are still dynamic and nobody should claim an exact number of deaths is known. ‚Äù But if he were an Indian citizen, he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs not sit there and do nothing about it. Let‚Äôs not be exposed to it today as more research is being done. ‚Äô‚Äù Although few studies of the health problems brought by air pollution are based in India, Dr. Ezzati said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to imagine air pollution that is bad for people in London is not bad for people in India. ‚Äù Neither India‚Äôs environment minister nor its environment secretary could be reached for comment Monday evening. Robert O‚ÄôKeefe, vice president at the Health Effects Institute, said China‚Äôs trajectory on deaths from air pollution had stabilized as a result of the country‚Äôs efforts to reduce air pollution. India, on the other hand, had yet to undertake sustained public policy initiatives to reduce pollution, said Gopal Sankaranarayanan, an advocate at the Supreme Court of India who successfully petitioned it to ban licenses to sell fireworks in the New Delhi metropolitan area last year. Fireworks during the festival of Diwali contributed to hazardous levels of air pollution late last year. Weak environmental regulation in India, he said, leaves India‚Äôs citizens with few alternatives other than to petition the courts to take action to protect the public‚Äôs health. But the courts often lack the power or mechanisms to enforce their actions, he said. India‚Äôs environmental court, the National Green Tribunal, ordered farmers to stop burning their crops in the region around New Delhi in 2015, but the practice still continued last year. Smoke from the farm fires contributed about one quarter of the levels of the most dangerous air pollution in the Indian capital, environmental experts said. ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt enforce the directives of the courts  ‚Äî   it becomes a problem,‚Äù Mr. Sankaranarayanan said. ‚ÄúWe need practical solutions to save lives here in India. ‚Äù",0

59753,Syria‚Äôs UN Envoy ‚ÄòAppalled‚Äô By Rebel Attacks On Civilians In Aleppo,"On Sunday Syrian state media said rebels had used chemical weapons against government-controlled districts of Aleppo. 

RT reports: 
Scores of civilians, including several children, were killed while hundreds of others were wounded in ‚Äúrelentless and indiscriminate‚Äù attacks carried out by opposition groups in the western districts of Aleppo, according to the UN statement. 
‚ÄúThose who argue that this is meant to relieve the siege of eastern Aleppo should be reminded that nothing justifies the use of disproportionate, indiscriminate [attacks,] including heavy weapons on civilian areas and it could amount to war crimes,‚Äù de Mistura said. 
He echoed the condemnation voiced by the UN secretary-general regarding the attacks on schools. The special envoy also criticized the ‚Äúuse of heavy airpower on civilian areas.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe civilians of both sides of Aleppo have suffered enough due to futile but lethal attempts of subduing the city of Aleppo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey now need and deserve a stable ceasefire covering this ancient city of Syria.‚Äù 
Earlier on Sunday, state news agency SANA reported that ‚Äúshells containing poison gases‚Äù had been fired at the residential district of al-Hamdaniya in western, government-held Aleppo. 
RT Arabic‚Äôs crew in Aleppo reported 36 cases of suffocation. Al-Mayadeen reported that all the victims of the attack are civilians. 
Just recently, the Russian Defense Ministry reported on a number of attacks in Aleppo that targeted schools and claimed the lives of at least three children in the period of 24 hours. Twelve more people died in an attack on a humanitarian aid corridor opened next to a school in the Al-Mashariq district, according to the ministry‚Äôs information. Twelve more people were injured. 
Meanwhile, according to Russia‚Äôs Permanent Mission to the United Nations, over 16,000 people have fallen victim to opposition groups meant to be under US control. ‚ÄúFrom February to September, the opposition groups that are supposed to be under the US control committed 2,031 violations of the [cessation of hostilities], which claimed lives of 3,532 military personnel and 12,800 civilians,‚Äù the Mission‚Äôs statement, published on the website of the Russian Foreign Ministry, reads. 
According to Dr. Said Sadek, professor of Political Sociology at the American University of Cairo, it‚Äôs not likely that Western powers and the Gulf states will end their backing for rebel groups, even if they are found responsible for using chemical weapons in Aleppo. ‚ÄúWe have to understand that for six years, the Western countries and the Gulf states invested in those ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô or radical groups, and so they cannot abandon them,‚Äù Sadek explained. ‚ÄúThey cannot pull out now and say, ‚ÄòOK we discovered that we are wrong, let‚Äôs get out and leave them.‚Äô They have invested in them and they will still use them for bargaining in the future of Syria.‚Äù",1

In 2014-15 Sellers was paid $347,295 in his capacity as vice provost, a position created in 2014. 
President Mark Schlissel nominated Sellers for the job several weeks ago. The new full-time administrative position ‚Äúwill serve as a leadership voice on diversity, equity and inclusion for the entire university.‚Äù 
The diversity plan Sellers will oversee will spend $17 million a year over the next five years. It seeks to ‚Äúrecruit, retain and develop a diverse university community‚Äù and ‚Äúsupport innovation and inclusive scholarship and teaching‚Äù through a number of new and expanded programs. 
The $85 million plan is in addition to the $40 million a year the university already spends promoting diversity.

13424,DEADBEATS BEWARE: Trump‚Äôs Food Stamp Reform Is Your Worst Nightmare,"All we re hearing from the left is fear mongering about President Trump s budget. We love what welfare to work is coming back after Obama stripped it out of requirements to receive benefits. Food stamp enrollment exploded during Obama s 8 years in office to be 44 million recipients.The American taxpayers are footing the bill for those who take advantage of the system. Here s the TRUTH about what the Trump administration has proposed for food stamps:WORK REQUIREMENTS: In reality, the president s proposed policy is based on two principles: requiring able-bodied adult recipients to work or prepare for work in exchange for benefits, and restoring minimal fiscal responsibility to state governments for the welfare programs they operate.The president s budget reasserts the basic concept that welfare should not be a one-way handout. Welfare should, instead, be based on reciprocal obligations between recipients and taxpayers.SHIFTING MORE RESPONSIBILITY ON STATES:Why should the federal government pay for almost all of the freebies? Shifting the responsibility to the states will help with accountability. Perhaps some of the states will make a better effort to clean up the fraud that s so rampant in the system.Read more: Daily Signal",1
