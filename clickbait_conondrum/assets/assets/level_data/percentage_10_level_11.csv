51624,Trump: Hillary Clinton may be 'most corrupt person ever' to run for president,"Email 
Donald Trump’s campaign debuted a dark new attack ad on Tuesday, looking to further its portrayal of Hillary Clinton as a corrupt politician and doubling down on allegations that she grew wealthy through “pay-to-play politics.”The TV spot hits Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, on controversies related to her family’s foundation, stating that “staggering amounts of cash poured into the Clinton Foundation from criminals, dictators, countries that hate America” and that “Hillary cut deals for donors.” 
Clinton’s charitable foundation has faced intense scrutiny this election over concerns about possible conflicts of interest because it took in money from corporations and foreign governments. Clinton has repeatedly denied, however, that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundation’s work or that she gave any special privileges to its donors.The Clintons have also said that the foundation, which contributes to AIDS relief abroad, among other charitable causes, will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected president.Still, the ad from the Republican nominee claims that Clinton “sold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, she even gave American uranium rights to the Russians.”“Hillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself,” its voice over concludes.The advertisement is another instance of Trump, an embattled candidate in an already divisive race, going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks. As Trump trails in the polls and high-profile Republicans abandon him, he has attacked Clinton and her husband’s character, going so far as to bring women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to watch the second debate in St. Louis last weekend.Some Republicans had called for him to drop out of the race after a 2005 recording emerged showing him bragging about sexual assault last week. But, attacking even Republican establishment figures like Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen. John McCain, Trump has promised to plow forward, and some observers suggest he has little to lose.“It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,” he tweeted on Tuesday.",1

67385,BREAKING NEWS: Reince Priebus Makes Early Return Home From Trump’s First Foreign Trip,"The White House confirmed to FOX Business that Priebus would be heading back to Washington D.C. after the stop in Saudi Arabia, part of the president s visit to the Middle East, and insisted this was always part of the administration s plan.Natalie Strom, assistant press secretary at the White House, told FOX Business,  It has always been planned for Reince to return to Washington following the Saudi Arabia portion of the trip. It s a big week in D.C. for the president s agenda with our budget release coming soon and discussions continuing on tax reform, so he s needed back at home for that. When asked which other officials would be coming home, Strom said,  Only a few senior administration officials are staying on for the whole trip, which is typical for these kinds of trips. They re attending the stops that most pertain to their responsibilities. Off the top of my head I know that Secretary [of State] Tillerson and General McMaster won t be on for the entirety. As FOX Business reported Friday, Priebus s position in the White House is once again in jeopardy as National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney are a few of the candidates under consideration to replace him if the president decides to go that route, according to sources close to the situation.On Friday, the White House did not deny the possibility that Priebus could be replaced.While the administration may believe it s typical for some officials to stay and others to head home, according to experts outside the White House, it s unusual for a chief of staff to head home early on such an important trip.

With only $4.7 million available, it s gonna be difficult to throw a coronation for Hillary. Already struggling with finances, the Democratic Party has drafted a plan to have taxpayers help pay about $20 million for next summer s nominating convention, reversing a change Congress approved just a year ago.Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who is also a congresswoman from Florida, has drafted a bill to restore money that both parties used to receive from the federal government to help defray the costs of running their quadrennial conventions.The Congressional Budget Office revealed the move in a letter released Friday, which said Ms. Wasserman Schultz s proposal to tap a presidential campaign fund would likely mean each party could get about $20 million in taxpayer money to help with costs.The DNC is facing tough financial circumstances. The latest report shows it had just $4.7 million in cash on hand as of Oct. 31, less than the $6.9 million in debts the committee reported. By contrast, the Republican National Committee reported $20.4 million in cash, offset by $1.9 million in debts.Neither the DNC nor Ms. Wasserman Schultz s congressional office returned messages seeking comment on her plans.Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore said the party doesn t need the help.Read more: WT",1
59370,"Gohmert: Obama DOJ, Not the Russians, Tried to Influence Presidential Election - Breitbart","In an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “America’s News HQ” on Sunday, Rep. Louis Gohmert ( ) said that if anyone interfered with the 2016 presidential election, it wasn’t the Russians but the Department of Justice.  He specifically named former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former FBI Director James Comey. Gohmert referred to Comey’s testimony last week before the Senate Intelligence Committee where he said Lynch had told him to refer to the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information as a “matter,” rather than an “investigation,” even though Clinton was under investigation. Comey said that led him to publicly announce the end of the Clinton investigation in July 2016. “At best, it was an attempt to manipulate the election, not by the Russians in this case, but by the Department of Justice  —   the Attorney General herself  —   because that came from Comey,”  Gohmert said. “[Comey] totally ruined his own credibility  —   or what was left of it,” Gohmert said. “He did vast damage and raised big red flags and questions over Loretta Lynch’s job as head of the Justice Department. “[Lynch] was using her official position to help the campaign of Hillary Clinton and that didn’t seem to bother him enough to do a memo,” Gohmert said. Gohmert said this should be the subject of a congressional investigation. “We need to round up all those people [Comey] talked to  —   because we have a conspiracy remaining afoot in the Department of Justice that is going to be out to destroy this president and they’ve got to be fired if not worse. ” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter @PennyStarrDC",0
2991,"WOW! GOP ELITISTS Get Hammered: “‘Weak-Kneed, Lily-Livered Republicans’ Put on ‘Despicable Display of Cowardice’ by Abandoning Trump”","The list of pathetic sore losers and RINO s in the GOP who have said they won t support Trump seemed to be growing longer and longer after the private, inappropriate comments Trump made 11 years ago became public. After last night s debate, I wonder how many of them wish they could take it back. Trump handled the discussion about what he called  embarrassing  behavior better than most of us expected. We all make mistakes. He was a private citizen who was having some boy talk on a bus. He used some bad words and regrets it. He never laid a hand on anyone, but the sore losers who Trump crushed in the primaries and other RINO s like Mitt Romney are using this opportunity to destroy Trump s chances at winning while elevating Hillary s. Unlike the Dems, who surround and shield members of their party to the end, these turncoats Republicans are not team players Sam Clovis, co-chairman of Donald Trump s presidential campaign, reviewed Sunday night s second presidential debate on Monday morning s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. I thought we did really well,  said Clovis.  I thought the first 15 minutes or so were pretty much as predicted, a little rocky, to be honest, but I think from that moment on, I don t think there s any question who was in charge, and I think he really had Mrs. Clinton on the defensive for most of the rest of the debate. Clovis disputed the notion that Clinton came to the debate to  talk about the issues. She s done everything she can to avoid the issues,  he said,  because her tax plan sucks. Her record in foreign policy sucks. She has no love for the military. She s a criminal, and she ought to be in prison. I mean, I m just being blunt: this is a woman who ought to be in prison right now. If you or I had done what she has done, we would be in handcuffs in an orange suit, and we would be in a maximum security federal prison right now. Clovis said it was  absolute nonsense  to construe Trump s call for a special prosecutor during the debate as a banana republic-style threat to jail his political opponent. Director Comey has already come out and said she essentially lied to the FBI,  he noted.  Martha Stewart lied to the FBI, and she went to prison. If Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI, she ought to be prosecuted. And right now, what we have is, we have a deal struck by the Clinton campaign with the Obama administration, and I think if push comes to shove, I think Obama will pardon her before this thing gets out of hand because if they think anything is going to reveal that she has committed more criminal acts than she already has, then I think he ll pardon her. I really do. I think this is in the works. And I don t think the American people are really fooled by this. What we re talking about is establishing the rule of law, and the rule of law applies to everyone. That includes the former secretary of state,  Clovis declared.Marlow asked how the Trump campaign planned to strategize around the intense media focus on his  hot mic  lewd remarks,  considering that even the Republican Party is now destroying Donald Trump over these comments. Well, I think again it goes to the substance of what we have is, we have a vulnerability in the campaign,  Clovis replied, adding,  This is a vulnerability. Let s make no mistake. Let s be honest about this. We have a situation here, comments that were made 11 years ago. They were recorded, and they ve come back to haunt the candidate. The candidate has apologized for those remarks. And I think what it goes to is the fact that they don t want to focus on policy. They don t want to focus on the substance of the issues because the establishments of the Republican Party and the Democrat Party writ large are deeply threatened by a populist movement in this country. I really think this is why you see these weak-kneed, lily-livered Republicans out here   I have other words, but I can t use them on the radio   that go to the heart of what I think is a despicable display of cowardice on the part of the Republican Party over this whole issue. We don t need to defend the comments. I think the comments were bad, and frankly, if my son had said something like that, I d have taken him back to the woodshed. I don t have any problems talking about that and saying that because that s what I think of the comments. The other side of it is, the comments aren t what we re after. What we re after is the substance of who s going to lead this country. And that s what we ought to be focused on because the alternative of having Hillary Clinton as President of the United States is just too terrible to contemplate.   Breitbart News",1
21795,FEDERAL JUDGE Goes On Rant About Cops Killing Blacks….Declares: “Black Lives Matter!”…Blames Deaths Of Cops On Cops,"This is a great story for anyone who doesn t understand the power one liberal judge can wield from the bench. U.S. District Judge Robart, who is presiding over a 2012 consent decree requiring the city to adopt reforms to address federal allegations of police bias, rebuked the Seattle police union for holding up reforms as it bargains over a new contract, The Seattle Times reported. The court and the citizens of Seattle will not be held hostage for increased payments and benefits,  the judge said, according to the paper. To hide behind a collective-bargaining agreement is not going to work,  he said.Kevin Stuckey, who recently became president of the Seattle Police Officers  Guild, said the union is prepared to sit down with the city and reach a deal.Judge Robart, a George W. Bush appointee, said proposed police reform legislation should include putting a civilian in charge of police oversight, shutting down a police-led disciplinary board and creating a civilian position of inspector general.Judge Robart threatened to call a hearing and override the city s bargaining process with the union if he concluded the union was interfering with reform, The Times reported. The judge ended Monday s hearing by citing a statistic that claimed 41 percent of the shootings nationwide by police were of blacks.  Black lives matter,  he said, drawing an audible reaction in a courtroom, The Times reported.Judge Robart added that the recent targeted shootings of police officers across the country signaled the importance of strengthening police and community relations.Commissioner Enrique Gonzalez said he s  very encouraged that a federal judge has actually said that black lives matter, because now we know that not only is this movement happening in the streets   even a federal judge has acknowledged that people of color have been on the receiving end of police brutality and this needs to change,  The Stranger reported.

61878,Saudi cleric suspended over 'quarter-brain' women drivers quip,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A Saudi cleric who said women should not drive because their brains shrink to a quarter the size of a man s when they go shopping has been banned from preaching, state television said. Saad al-Hijri was suspended from all religious activity after advising against allowing women to drive in a speech that contained comments  diminishing human value , the broadcaster quoted a spokesman for the governor of Asir province as saying. Ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that bans women from driving, despite ambitious government targets to increase their public role, especially in the workforce. Women in the kingdom are also bound by law to wear long robes and a headscarf and require the consent of a male guardian for most legal actions. In a video identifying him as the head of the religious edicts department in the southern province, Hijri asked what the traffic department would do it if it discovered a man with only half a brain.  Would it give him a license or not? It would not. So how can it give it to a woman when she has only half?  he said.  If she goes to the market she loses another half. What is left? A quarter...We demand the traffic department check because she is not suitable to drive and she has only a quarter.  The comments sparked anger on social media, which is hugely popular in the kingdom. Twitter users shared the video, many criticising it and making jokes about his remarks, under the Arabic hashtag  Al-Hijri_women_quarter_brain  Some users posted pictures of Saudi female scientists and academics in response and questioned Hijri s own intellectual capacities. His suspension, ordered by the provincial governor, was aimed at preventing the spread of views that spark controversy and do not serve the national interest, the provincial spokesman said, according to Ekhbariya TV s official Twitter account. Any others who used religious platforms to preach such views would also be banned. The government s modernizing reforms, backed by Saudi Arabia s business class, have sparked tensions with influential clerics upon whose support the ruling family relies. Some clerics have millions of followers on social media. ",0
32103,"OOPS! Media Forgot Ted Kennedy Asked Russia To Intervene In Election, Help Defeat Ronald Reagan","In 1991 a reporter for the London Times found a very interesting memorandum composed in 1983 by Victor Chebrikov, the top man in the KGB.  The memo was addressed to Yuri Andropov, the top man in the USSR.  The subject: Sen. Edward KennedyThe memorandum reads in part:  On 9-10 May of this year, Sen. Edward Kennedy s close friend and trusted confidant [John] Tunney was in Moscow.  The senator charged Tunney to convey the following message, through confidential contacts, to the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Y. Andropov. The message included an offer to visit Moscow  The main purpose of the meeting, according to the senator, would be to arm Soviet officials with explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament so they may be better prepared and more convincing during appearances in the USA.   Kennedy was offering to help Soviet Russia deal with President Reagan, by telling them how to paint their propaganda picture.Via Forbes: The document,  Kengor continues,  has stood the test of time. I scrutinized it more carefully than anything I ve ever dealt with as a scholar. I showed the document to numerous authorities who deal with Soviet archival material. No one has debunked the memorandum or shown it to be a forgery. Kennedy s office did not deny it. As part of the deal, Kennedy promised to make sure that certain American news networks gave Andropov air time and would go soft on him while still making it look like true journalism.Why would Kennedy do this, you might ask? Tunney remarked that the senator wants to run for president in 1988,  the memorandum continued.  Kennedy does not discount that during the 1984 campaign, the Democratic Party may officially turn to him to lead the fight against the Republicans and elect their candidate president. So apparently, if a democratic senator actually seeks out help from Soviet Russia to beat his opponent, that s ok, but if a Republican cabinet member so much as has contacts in Russia, the gloves come off.(Source: Forbes)",1

By Brianna Acuesta This island costs less than most celebrity homes. 
A Scottish island by the name of Tanera Mor is for sale, as its permanent residents recently moved out and put the island, along with its cafe, post office, schoolhouse, and 9 homes, on the market. 
The island boasts stunning views, traditional houses that have been recently restored, and self-sufficiency that is unmatched on other islands. 
The 760-acre isle is powered by wind turbines and generators and has a freshwater treatment plant. It’s part of a group of other islands called the Summer Isles and has an established tourism business that brings in a bit of revenue. 
This particular island is the biggest in the isles and is located just 1.5 miles away from the Scottish coast. 
The scenery itself is reason enough to buy this island, or any of the three lots that are being offered separately. It’s got 7 miles of cliffs, coves, and beaches to meander and relax on and you can walk across the whole island easily because it’s only 1.6 miles long. 
Over 164,000 native trees were recently planted to combat severe winds, giving the island a more natural feel. Despite the winds, the surrounding waters are said to be ideal for aquatic hobbies such as sailing, fishing, and diving; there’s even a historic pier to utilize for some of these activities. Also listed on the website for this property is that it’s common to look out and see porpoises, dolphins, basking sharks, and otters close by. 
Included in the sale are four neighboring small islands that are completely uninhabited but contain tidal pools and other treasures. Considering a nice apartment in a big city like Manhattan costs just as much and has considerably less space, this deal may seem like a steal. While you might be giving up that city vibe, you’d be replacing it with amazing views and a relaxing life. 
Would you consider buying this island? Please share, like, and comment on this article!

61296,Putin BURNS Legal System For Letting “Sexual Emergency” Migrant Walk FREE After Molesting Boy,"0 comments 
There are things that we tend not to agree with when it comes to Putin. However, I think when you see the point he is trying to make here, this is common ground we can all meet on and agree with one another on. 
His reason for being upset with the government is clear. They allowed a sexual predator free for reasons that are so asinine that one could think the defendant himself made the ruling. 
It’s sickening.. 
The Russian president rarely comments on the internal affairs of European countries, and even less on specific court cases. However, Mr. Putin refused to stay silent this week as he slammed the Austrian justice system over a case in which the infamous “sexual emergency” migrant rapist was alleged to have been acquitted by an Austrian court who will seek a retrial on the case, reports OE24. 
According to Mr. Putin, the court’s decision was the result of a “dissolution of traditional national values”. He added: “In a European country a child is raped by a migrant. The court acquitted him for two reasons: he speaks the language poorly and he did not understand that the boy, yes it was a boy, didn’t want this.” 
Putin called the resulting court ruling inconceivable and said that a nation that refuses to defend its children has no future. “This is the result of the dissolution of traditional national values and a sense of guilt towards migrants,” he said. 
Breitbart London reported on the attack, which occurred late last year, in which the Iraqi asylum seeker brutally raped a ten-year-old boy in a swimming pool in the Austrian capital of Vienna. 
The boy was so brutally assaulted that he had to be hospitalised for his injuries and the migrant, when asked why he committed the crime, claimed it had been a “sexual emergency”. The phrase became notorious on social media as many used it to highlight the clear social problems many of the new migrants presented to European societies. 
According to Austria’s chief justice, the migrant had not, in fact, been acquitted of the charges, but rather the trial was expected to be re-run on the basis that the boy now suffers post-traumatic stress disorder. This new charge could allow prosecutors to put the Iraqi behind bars for up to 15 years. 
Putin says when a country refuses to protect its’ children, it becomes a country with no future. What do you think about that, would you agree? Related Items",1

39973,iPhone Tricks – 15 Secret iPhone Codes,"posted by Eddie A list of secret Apple iPhone codes that can unlock a raft of hidden features and settings has been revealed, allowing users to do anything from enhancing their call quality to checking their mobile balance. While Android is particularly well known for offering a rabbit-hole of an operating system that can be tweaked and tinkered with, Apple’s iOS has kept menus and settings relatively simple and locked down. However, there is a way that users can drill down to find some gems not seen on the surface. If you want to find out how many minutes you have left on your phone tariff, what your IMEI number (something you’ll need if you swap phone networks) or even find out a way to enhance your iPhone’s voice quality there’s a way to do it that you won’t find by going to your normal phone’s settings. Redmond Pie revealed a full list of the codes and how to use them. By typing in the following secret USSD codes on the dialpad of the phone then pressing the call button you can bring up these tricks: *3001#12345#* :Field Test mode *#5005*7672# : SMS centre number *3370# : Turn on or off EFR (Enhanced Full Rate), a mode that improves your iPhone’s call quality *#06# : Find out your iPhone’s IMEI number *#31# : Hide your number on calls option *#43# : Check if call waiting is on or off *43# : Turn on call waiting #43# : Turn off call waiting *646# : Check minutes left on contract *225# : Find out your current mobile account balance *777# : Find out prepaid account balance *#61# : Number of missed calls *#21# : Call forwarding status *#67# : Call forwarding number *#33# : Find out what mobile services are disabled on your phone One of the most interesting of the USSD codes is the Field Test mode, which allows users to see their phone-signal strength measured in numbers rather than those five bars. You’ll see something displaying such as ‘-90’, with the number going up and down depending on signal. A value above -80 is a full-bar strength, but anything below -110 is very weak. This is a more accurate way of seeing whether you have enough signal to make a call, rather than holding on to hope with one-bar. It’s worth noting that you should only use these codes and play around with your settings at your own risk, if you’re not sure what something does better leave it be. source:",1
68054,REVEALED: The Establishment’s Scheme to Take Down Trump,"21st Century Wire says Based on the events we have seen over the past two months   the Democrat-organized street protests and calls to abolish the Electoral College, Democrat intimidation of electors, the pseudo recount  by the Democratic Party and their willing agent Jill Stein, the evidence-free DNI Report on the alleged  Russian Hack  and the fake  Trump-Russia Blackmail  dossier, as well as radical left-wing plans to  shut down next week s inauguration and block the transfer of power in Washington  you can be absolutely certain that the losing party will not give up and have yet to unveil some more audacious plans  designed to unseat the new 45th President of the United States, Donald J Trump.    If Trump makes it past the inauguration on Jan 20th, expect a serious purge to take place in Washington DC, as the new administration attempt to remove those who are hell-bent on sabotaging the political process and transfer of power.All you need to know about this dodgy dossier   fabricated and then laundered by anti-Russian war hawk John McCain in a way which seems to be standard practice for Washington s political and media hacks alike: But this is what one would expect of a document based entirely of hearsay in which Source A claims to have gotten a juicy tidbit from Source B, who heard it from Source C deep inside the Kremlin. Constortium News Exclusive: The U.S. intelligence community s unprecedented assault on an incoming U.S. president   now including spreading salacious rumors   raises questions about how long Donald Trump can hold the White House, says Daniel Lazare  Daniel Lazare Consortium NewsIs a military coup in the works? Or are U.S. intelligence agencies laying the political groundwork for forcing Donald Trump from the presidency because they can t abide his rejection of a new cold war with Russia? Not long ago, even asking such questions would have marked one as the sort of paranoid nut who believes that lizard people run the government. But no longer.Thanks to the now-notorious 35-page dossier concerning Donald Trump s alleged sexual improprieties in a Moscow luxury hotel, it s clear that strange maneuverings are underway in Washington and that no one is quite sure how they will end.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper added to the mystery Wednesday evening by releasing a 200-word statement to the effect that he was shocked, shocked, that the dossier had found its way into the press. Such leaks, the statement said,  are extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security. Clapper added: that this document is not a US Intelligence Community product and that I do not believe the leaks came from within the IC. The IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions. However, part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security. Rather than vouching for the dossier s contents, in other words, all Clapper says he did was inform Trump that it was making the rounds in Washington and that he should know what it said   and that he thus couldn t have been more horrified than when Buzzfeed posted all 35 pages on its website.But it doesn t make sense. As The New York Times noted,  putting the summary in a report that went to multiple people in Congress and the executive branch made it very likely that it would be leaked  (emphasis in the original). So even if the  intelligence community  didn t leak the dossier itself, it distributed it knowing that someone else would.Then there is The Guardian, second to none in its loathing for Trump and Vladimir Putin and hence intent on giving the dossier the best possible spin. It printed a quasi-defense not of the memo itself but of the man who wrote it: Christopher Steele, an ex-MI6 officer who now heads his own private intelligence firm. A sober, cautious and meticulous professional with a formidable record  is how the Guardiandescribed him. Then it quoted an unnamed ex-Foreign Office official on the subject of Steele s credibility: The idea his work is fake or a cowboy operation is false, completely untrue. Chris is an experienced and highly regarded professional. He s not the sort of person who will simply pass on gossip.   If he puts something in a report, he believes there s sufficient credibility in it for it to be worth considering. Chris is a very straight guy. He could not have survived in the job he was in if he had been prone to flights of fancy or doing things in an ill-considered way. In other words, Steele is a straight-shooter, so it s worth paying attention to what he has to say. Or so the Guardian assures us. That is the way the CIA and the FBI, not to mention the British government, regarded him, too,  it adds, so presumably Clapper felt the same way.What is Afoot?So what does it all mean? Simply that U.S. intelligence agencies believed that the dossier came from a reliable source and that, as a consequence, there was a significant possibility that Trump was a  Siberian candidate,  as Times columnist Paul Krugman once described him. They therefore sent out multiple copies of a two-page summary on the assumption that at least one would find its way to the press.Even if Clapper & Co. took no position concerning the dossier s contents, they knew that preparing and distributing such a summary amounted to a tacit endorsement. They also knew, presumably, that it would provide editors with an excuse to go public. If the CIA, FBI, and National Security Agency feel that Steele s findings are worthy of attention, then why shouldn t the average reader have an opportunity to examine them as well?How did Clapper expect Trump to respond when presented with allegations that he was vulnerable to Russian blackmail and potentially under the Kremlin s thumb? Did he expect him to hang his head in shame, break into great racking sobs, and admit that it was all true? If so, did Clapper \then plan to place a comforting hand on Trump s shoulder and suggest, gently but firmly, that it was time to step aside and allow a trusted insider like Mike Pence to take the reins?Based on the sturm und drang of the last few days, the answer is very possibly yes. If so, the gambit failed when Trump, in his usual high-voltage manner, denounced the dossier as  fake news  and sailed into the intelligence agencies for behaving like something out of  Nazi Germany. The intelligence community s hopes, if that s what they were, were dashed.All of which is thoroughly unprecedented by American political standards. After all, this is a country that takes endless pride in the peaceful transfer of power every four years or so. Yet here was the intelligence community attempting to short-circuit the process by engineering Trump s removal before he even took office.But the Guardian then upped the ante even more by suggesting that the CIA continue with the struggle. Plainly, the Republican congressional leadership has  no appetite  for an inquiry into Steele s findings, the paper s New York correspondent, Ed Pilkington, wrote, adding: That leaves the intelligence agencies. The danger for Trump here is that he has so alienated senior officials, not least by likening them to Nazis, that he has hardly earned their loyalty. What was the Guardian suggesting   that disloyal intelligence agents keep on searching regardless? And what if they come up with what they claim is a smoking gun?Explained Pilkington:  To take a flight of fancy, what if it [i.e. Steele s findings] were substantiated? That would again come down to a question of politics. No US president has ever been forced out of office by impeachment (Richard Nixon resigned before the vote; Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were acquitted by the Senate). Any such procedure would have to be prepared and approved by a majority of the House of Representatives, and then passed to the Senate for a two-thirds majority vote. As the Republicans hold the reins in both chambers, it would take an almighty severing of ties between Trump and his own party to even get close to such a place. It s a long shot, but the Guardian s recommendation is that rogue agents keep on digging until they strike pay dirt, at which point they should go straight to Congress and persuade   if not pressure   the Republican leadership to initiate the process of throwing Trump out of office.This is not the same as sending an armored column to attack Capitol Hill, but it s close. Essentially, the Guardian was calling on the intelligence agencies to assume ultimate responsibility regarding who can sit in the Oval Office and who cannot Continue this story at Consortium NewsREAD MORE ELECTIONS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",1
66141," Donald Trump Promotes Shooting Muslims With Bullets Dipped In Pig’s Blood, Gets An Ovation (VIDEO)","During a rally in California, GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump praised a bogus historical incident where Muslims were shot by bullets dipped in pig s blood   to rapturous applause.It appears that neither Donald Trump, nor the crowd in Costa Mesa, are aware that there is no evidence this historical incident actually happened. Given the campaign s focus on rhetoric over fact to date, t s unlikely anyone would care either. But for the record, Trump was praising the vile actions of U.S. General John Joseph Pershing. The story goes that the General cracked down on Islamic terrorism in the early 20th century with a single act of terror of his own. As Trump delights in telling the crowd, reciting it as if historical fact, the General dipped bullets in pigs blood, then shot 49 Muslims   letting the 50th off to act as a cautionary tale.Trump s point? That only the most brutal measures will make America safe from Islamic terrorism   that any and all means of persecution and punishment are justified. Even, apparently, mass murder. And the crowd went wild, erupting into applause   some breaking out into a standing ovation.It s not even the first time Trump has wheeled out the story either. Despite the fact that this complete and morbid fantasy was taken to pieces when just two months ago when he last road-tested it. Trump came back for more last night in California.What makes the matter all the more galling, is this is pure fairytale. As Mediaite s Josh Feldman has written previously:There has been a persistent rumor for years that United States General John Pershing cracked down on Islamic terrorism in the early 1900s by dipping bullets in pig s blood and shooting Muslim prisoners with them. This is a hoax. It has never been proven.In addition, the popular fact-checking site Politifact undertook their own investigation in the tale, and they ended up rating it as  Pants on Fire. This means they could find literally no truth whatsoever in the claims.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWcinTg9K98Ladies and Gentlemen, we present to you the potential future President of the United States.Featured Image via Screengrab",1

This firm is a breeding ground for interdepartmental turf wars, and we must implement some basic cross-functional solutions’. 
Steven continued shouting quite loudly at every available opportunity about a matter of negligible significance – a chain email entitled: ‘Stationery cupboard low on blue pens’. 
Mr. Parker runs his own family business and that his 2 support staff, wife Jenny and daughter Emma, completely despise him. jonessgl",1

34797, Trump Just Made A Hugely Inappropriate Threat Over Trumpcare While Speaking To Boy Scouts (VIDEO),"With the Trumpcare vote coming up tomorrow, The Donald is out stumping for support for the bill, and being really inappropriate about it. He actually asked Navy personnel to call their Congresspeople about healthcare, and now he s threatening his own Health and Human Services secretary, Tom Price, in front of Boy Scouts.Yes, that s right, while speaking at the Boy Scout Jamboree in Virginia today, Trump decided it was not only appropriate to get political and do nonsense like demand more loyalty, but he also pointed directly to Price at one point and said,  By the way, you re going to get the votes?

He better get  em,  in reference to getting the necessary votes to move the disastrous Trumpcare bill to the Senate floor for debate.He also said,  He better get Senator Capito to vote for it.

AMAZON TELLS CUSTOMER THEY WERE FORCED BY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT To Remove Confederate Flag From Website,"When it comes to limiting our free speech, nothing this lawless government does should surprise us. Under  normal  circumstances, I would question the validity of this claim, but we are no longer living under  normal  circumstances Amazon.com staff are telling irate customers that the company was ordered by the federal government not to sell items featuring the Confederate flag in the aftermath of the Charleston shooting.Amazon made the announcement this week, along with eBay, Sears and Walmart, that it would no longer sell products bearing the rebel flag, but according to a conversation posted on YouTube between a customer and an Amazon sales rep, the decision could have been made as a result of pressure from the government.At first the Amazon staffer claims that the items were banned because they were deemed to be offensive, but when pressed by the customer, the sales rep tells a different story. Is this a political statement by Amazon.com or is this a directive that you re following, that the government said you know we want you guys not to sell these anymore?  asks the caller. The government is not allowing us to sell this Confederate flag,  responds the staffer. So the government is not allowing you .to sell it?  asks the caller, to which the sales rep responds,  yes. So Amazon is not making a political statement, this is something the government told you to do?  questions the caller. Exactly,  responds the staffer.Via: InfoWars",1
