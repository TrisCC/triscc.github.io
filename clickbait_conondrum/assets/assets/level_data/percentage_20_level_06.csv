12519,TAXPAYERS PAID SAME WOMEN WHO CRUSHED BABIES’ SKULLS FOR LIVING AND SOLD THEIR LUNGS TO ADVISE OBAMA ADMIN ON “Healthy Baby” BIRTHS,"No conflict of interest here! Only the most pro-abortion president in the history of the United States would have an  expert  who butchers babies for a living being paid by the American taxpayer to advise on healthy baby births  Deborah Nucatola the Planned Parenthood doc with the stone-cold heart and the lucrative skill of  crushing  babies in just the right spot has been advising the Obama administration on family planning policy since 2010.From April 2010 through April 2014, Nucatola was one of several experts the U.S. Health and Human Services Office of Population Affairs (OPA) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of Reproductive Health tasked with creating federal guidelines for  quality family planning services.  A member of the  Expert Work Group  and the  Technical Panel on Clinical Women s Services,  Nucatola was actively engaged in the  multistage process  that produced the government s 2014 report,  Providing Quality Family Planning Services  (QFP).Her responsibilities as a  technical  consultant and an  expert  included analyzing research summaries and professional advisories, providing  individual feedback  on the government s initial recommendations,  reviewing  the CDC-OPA staff s  core recommendations,  giving her expert  opinion,  and then approving the recommendations. (See the report s appendices for the names of Expert Work Group members and technical experts, and detailed descriptions of the experts  involvement in formulating the report s recommendations.)What s the goal of those government recommendations? To help  clients achieve their desired number and spacing of children and increase the likelihood that those children are born healthy. Leave it to the Obama administration to tap an abortionist for  expert  advice on ensuring that children are  born healthy an abortionist, mind you, who relishes butchering a  17-weeker  and bagging up a tiny infant s  heart, lung, liver  to sell for a few extra bucks.Taxpayers Reward BarbarismThe barbaric nature of Nucatola s chosen work, however, is all too clear. That s reprehensible. Sen. Rand Paul and others have announced plans to defund Planned Parenthood in light of the Nucatola debacle. Good, but not enough.We need to delegitimize Planned Parenthood and delegitimize the cruel doctors whose expertise consists in knowing which parts of the unborn baby to  crush  in order to to harvest the money-producing parts  intact.  We need to insist that being an expert in baby dismemberment disqualifies instead of qualifies a doctor from being an  expert  consultant for the government an expert on making sure children are  born healthy,  no less.Planned Parenthood runs a bloody business. Many Americans are seeing, for the first time, the chilling, violent reality of abortion and the insatiable greed driving America s abortion business. Now, the question is: What is Congress willing to do about it?Read more of exclusive story: The Federalist",1

The emails also include an exchange between Abedin, Clinton personal assistant Lauren Jiloty, and Iris Anaya, the assistant to sugar magnate and Clinton Foundation donor Alfonso Fanjul concerning a request for special access to Clinton. On October 13, 2009, Anaya emailed Abedin seeking to arrange a meeting between Fanjul, the CEO of Florida Crystals, and Clinton. Jiloty responded the next day, asking that Anaya talk with Clinton scheduler Lona Valmoro about “setting up a meeting.” Fanjul donated more than $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation and was a Bill Clinton co-chairman in Florida. 
In an October 26, 2009, email exchange, power attorney and Hillary Clinton financial supporter, Charlie Ann Syprett, contacted Doug Band, apparently seeking help in getting around U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) restrictions on U.S. citizens’ ability to travel to Cuba. Syprett ostensibly wanted a waiver from the restrictions to enable people from her organization, SYC Charitable Foundation, to travel to Cuba, noting “we are not asking for something out of the ordinary.” 
The emails also show that Valmoro sent Clinton’s government schedule to the unsecure email addresses of numerous members of the Clinton Foundation staff on October 16, 2009, again on October 18, 2009, and on October 25, 2009. The emails also include discussions of personnel matters and appointments on Clinton’s unsecure account, which may run afoul of federal privacy law. 
This is the thirteenth set of records produced for Judicial Watch by the State Department from the non-state.gov email accounts of Huma Abedin. The documents were produced under a court order in a May 5, 2015, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the State Department requiring the agency to produce “all emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013, using a ‘non-state’.gov email address” ( Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)). Previous records releases documented special Clinton State Department consideration for Clinton Foundation supporters (see here , here , and here .) 
“We’ve once again uncovered classified information in Hillary Clinton’s and Huma Abedin’s emails,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “It is frankly remarkable that the FBI and Justice Department are only now investigating Abedin’s connection to Clinton’s mishandling of classified information.”",1
32697,"A List of Priorities From Trump, and Kris Kobach Tips His Hand - The New York Times","With Thanksgiving approaching, the transition team is putting the last touches on   Donald J. Trump’s national security leadership even as Mr. Trump pivots to his domestic and economic policy cabinet posts. One visitor to Trump Tower on Monday is of note: a Democrat, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. Another, Secretary of State Kris Kobach of Kansas, let the world see part of his plans for the Department of Homeland Security.   Trump has yet to hold a news conference, but he did release what aides said should suffice for now, a video news  release on his immediate plans: Scrap the   Partnership trade deal with 11 other Pacific Rim countries, junk President Obama’s environmental regulations to boost production of coal and natural gas and ban administration officials from lobbying for five years, among other items. Mr. Kobach, the conservative Kansas secretary of state, may have been a little too loose with his plans for the Department of Homeland Security. Entering Trump Tower, the     up for the job of secretary of homeland security, was photographed carrying a document titled “Kobach Strategic Plan for First 365 Days. ” Some of it was obscured by his arm, but not all. Under “Bar the Entry of Potential Terrorists,” the document called for reintroducing the “National Security   Registration System” implemented after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and suspended a decade later. It also calls for “extreme vetting questions” for “  aliens. ” Questions included support for Sharia law, jihad and the equality of men and women. The document also calls for an end to entry for Syrian refugees. Ms. Gabbard, an Iraq war veteran and former Bernie Sanders supporter, defended her visit Monday to the office of the   saying she needed to talk foreign policy with Mr. Trump “before the drumbeats of war that neocons have been beating drag us into an escalation of the war to overthrow the Syrian government. ” Her statement, lengthy and somewhat defensive, allowed, “While the rules of political expediency would say I should have refused to meet with   Trump, I never have and never will play politics with American and Syrian lives. ” She then made the case against any intervention in a war that has pulled in Russia and left hundreds of thousands slaughtered. Her case is a break from the position that her fellow Democrat, Hillary Clinton, campaigned on. It fits nicely with Mr. Trump’s reluctance to engage  —   and with warnings against American involvement from the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin. And speaking of Ms. Gabbard, Kellyanne Conway, a Trump senior adviser and his campaign manager, took some time on Monday to laud the fledgling rebellion in Democratic ranks against the liberal old guard. Speaking to reporters, Ms. Conway praised Ms. Gabbard’s willingness to buck the party, boosted Representative Tim Ryan, a Democrat from Youngstown, Ohio, who is challenging Representative Nancy Pelosi’s leadership, and had kind words for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has said Democrats need to focus more on economic struggles and less on the grievances of minorities and women. “Bernie Sanders today was also quoted as saying they should stop identity politics in the Democratic Party. Whoa. He can call and we’ll tell him how to do that and win,” she said. Mr. Sanders struck back in his way, declaring the Trump infrastructure a scam for   investors. Ms. Conway also weighed in on the growing scrutiny of the  ’s business pursuits, which appear to be continuing even as he prepares to lead the free world. She also made it clear she did not like reporters questioning his continuing business pursuits. “Do you ask people how long they will play golf and do the transition? Are you suggesting he is doing something illegal?” she snapped. “I already said he is not. But the presumption is that he is. ” A coterie of leading television executives and   personalities met Monday with the   for an    meeting. Depending on the accounts, it may or may not have gone swimmingly. The New York Post wrote it up as a battle royal. “Trump kept saying, ‘We’re in a room of liars, the deceitful, dishonest media who got it all wrong,’” the  ’s favorite tabloid wrote. Ms. Conway said the meeting had been “mischaracterized. ” “No, he did not explode in anger,” she said. Among those spotted were NBC’s Deborah Turness, MSNBC’s Phil Griffin, CNN’s Jeff Zucker and Wolf Blitzer, Fox News’s Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace and Suzanne Scott, and CBS’s John Dickerson and Charlie Rose. Former Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts emerged from the gilded elevators of Trump Tower on Monday to do what most visitors have not: Make a public case to be in the  ’s cabinet. Specifically, the man who lost a Senate seat to Elizabeth Warren, then failed to win another in New Hampshire, wants to be secretary of veterans affairs. “We obviously spoke about my passion and his passion, which are veterans and veterans issues,” he told the news media. “The toughest job in the cabinet is to lead the V. A. because it has, while it has so many angels working there, it has so many great problems as well. So he’s obviously going to take my application, or interest, under consideration. I’m glad that he called. ” He did acknowledge he was not a sure thing, despite his early and passionate advocacy for candidate Trump in New Hampshire, which Mrs. Clinton narrowly carried. “I think I’m the best person, but there are some tremendous people out there, and I don’t look at it as a competition,” he said. Perhaps it was impolitic of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s senior adviser, to praise conservative women like Sarah Palin and Ann Coulter by saying their leadership “would be   they would have husbands, they would love their children. ” “They wouldn’t be a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools up in New England,” he said in a 2011 radio interview. Now the heads of Barnard College, Bryn Mawr College, Mount Holyoke College, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, Smith College, Vassar College and Wellesley College are asking the future senior White House adviser to “take a more expansive, informed and tolerant worldview. ” “Our alumnae are accomplished leaders in all spheres of public and professional life they are committed to their work, their families and their countries. Now more than ever, we look to those who would lead the United States of America for a message of inclusion, respect and unity,” they wrote in an open letter to Mr. Bannon. Hillary Clinton’s popular vote lead surged above 1. 72 million on Sunday night, with millions of votes still to count. At 1. 3 percentage points, she has built a lead not seen in a losing campaign since Rutherford B. Hayes’s bitterly disputed election of 1876. The 2016 results have no such disputes, however. Mrs. Clinton’s lead keeps rising on her strength in California, where her margin stands at 29 percentage points, up from President Obama’s 23 percentage points 2012. She has failed to close the gap in any of the swing states that she lost, though Mr. Trump’s lead in Michigan has dwindled to 11, 612 votes, a bad night in Tiger Stadium. Florida certified its results on Sunday, sealing Mr. Trump’s margin of victory at 1. 2 percentage points.   candidates in Florida easily took enough votes to swing the results. But more Americans seem prepared to give Mr. Trump a chance. A new Morning Consult poll found that 46 percent of registered voters view the   favorably, the same number that see him unfavorably. Just before the election, 37 percent of voters viewed him favorably, while 61 percent viewed him unfavorably.",0

64335,The Greatest Wealth Transfer In History Nears As ‘Deep State’ Now Pulling Out All The Stops,"43 Views November 08, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News 
On election day, today John Embry told King World News that the greatest wealth transfer in history nears as the ‘Deep State’ is now pulling out all the stops. 
‘Deep State’ Desperation John Embry: “Eric, mercifully election day in the U.S. has finally arrived to put an end to the ugly spectacle which has been billed as the presidential campaign. The capper came on Monday, when in response to the FBI ending its investigation of Hillary Clintons email transgressions, the Dow magically rallied back to 18,200, a level which had been defended for months by the powers that be… Continue reading the John Embry interview below… Advertisement To hear what billionaire Eric Sprott & Rick Rule are doing with their own money and which $7 billion company John Embry & Dr. Marc Faber oversee click on the logo: 
John Embry continues: “ Simultaneously gold and silver were viciously attacked, while virtually every other asset category, including oil and copper, which incidentally have terrible fundamentals, rose in price. This represents business as usual as the ‘Deep State’ pulls out all stops to have their candidate Hillary Clinton elected. 
I suspect that in the fullness of time Monday will be seen as one of the most ridiculous days in market history, irrespective of who wins the election. The sad fact is that the U.S. problems now run so deep that no president has any ability at this stage to address the situation and bring back the good old days of sustainable growth and containable inflation. I believe that we are going to see rising inflation in conjunction with a steadily weakening economy as the staggering debt load takes its inevitable toll. 
I laughed when I saw the headlines in the New York Times and the London Financial Times in the wake of last week’s lousy jobs numbers, which incidentally would have been a whole lot worse if they weren’t so heavily doctored. The New York Times headline screamed, ‘Unemployment Hits 2008 Low, Wages Increase.’ The FT stated, ‘Wage Data Underlines Solid Jobs Market As Poll Nears.’ These newspapers are now so compromised that they shouldn’t be referred to as newspapers, but rather government propaganda machines. The old Soviet Pravda operation would be green with envy. In reality, U.S. federal government tax withholdings are now falling, giving a much better indication of the true state of the U.S. economy. 
The sharp fall in gold and silver on Monday provided yet another excellent buying opportunity. But irrespective of who is the next U.S. president, both metals will be heading sharply higher as financial reality overtakes the present pre-election fantasy. I would echo James Turk’s excellent advice on KWN yesterday when he said, ‘Own   assets.’ I believe he is dead right, and as I’ve said many times, before this saga is over we are going to witness the greatest wealth transfer in history and one best be on the right side of that transaction.”

30953,War Breaks Out Between Neo-Cons And Libertarians Over Trump's Foreign Policy,"Written by Tyler Durden Sunday November 20, 2016 In late October, when it was still conventional wisdom that Hillary was ""guaranteed"" to win the presidency, the WaPo explained that among the neo-con, foreign policy ""elites"" of the Pentagon, a feeling of calm content had spread: after all, it was just a matter of time before the ""pacifist"" Obama was out, replaced by the more hawkish Hillary. As the WaPo reported , ""there is one corner of Washington where Donald Trump’s scorched-earth presidential campaign is treated as a mere distraction and where bipartisanship reigns. In the rarefied world of the Washington foreign policy establishment, President Obama’s departure from the White House — and the possible return of a more conventional and hawkish Hillary Clinton — is being met with quiet relief."" The Republicans and Democrats who make up the foreign policy elite are laying the groundwork for a more assertive American foreign policy via a flurry of reports shaped by officials who are likely to play senior roles in a potential Clinton White House. Oops. Not only did the ""foreign policy"" elite get the Trump ""scorched-earth distraction"" dead wrong, it now has to scramble to find what leverage - if any - it has in defining Trump's foreign policy. Worse, America's warmongers are now waging war (if only metaphorically: we all know they can't wait for the real thing) against libertarians for direct access to Trump's front door, a contingency they had never planned for. As The Hill reported earlier , ""a battle is brewing between the GOP foreign policy establishment and outsiders over who will sit on President-elect Donald Trump’s national security team. The fight pits hawks and neoconservatives who served in the former Bush administrations against those on the GOP foreign policy edges."" Taking a page out of Ron Paul's book, the libertarians, isolationists and realists see an opportunity to pull back America's commitments around the world, spend less money on foreign aid and “nation-building,” curtail expensive military campaigns and troop deployments, and intervene militarily only to protect American interests. In short: these are people who believe that human life, and the avoidance of war, is more valuable than another record quarter for Raytheon, Lockheed or Boeing. On the other hand, the so-called establishment camp, many of whom disavowed Trump during the campaign, is made up of the same people who effectively ran Hillary Clinton's tenure while she was Secretary of State, fully intent on creating zones of conflict, political instability and outright war in every imaginable place, from North Africa to Ukraine. This group is pushing for Stephen Hadley, who served as national security adviser under George W. Bush. Another Bush ally, John Bolton whose name has been floated as a possible secretary of State, also falls into this camp. According to The Hill, other neo-con, establishment candidates floated include Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), outgoing Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), rising star Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and senior fellow at conservative think-tank American Enterprise Institute and former Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.). ""These figures all generally believe that the United States needs to take an active role in the world from the Middle East to East Asia to deter enemies and reassure allies."" In short, should this group prevail, it would be the equivalent of 4 more years of HIllary Clinton running the State Department. The outsider group sees things differently. They want to revamp American foreign policy in a different direction from the last two administrations. Luckily, this particular camp is also more in line with Trump’s views questioning the value of NATO, a position that horrified many in the establishment camp. “How many people sleep better knowing that the Baltics are part of NATO? They don't make us safer, in fact, quite the opposite. We need to think really hard about these commitments,” said William Ruger, vice president of research and policy at the Charles Koch Institute. A prominent member of the outsiders is Rand Paul, skeptic of Bush’s foreign policy, who has criticized Bolton in the last few days. Paul on Tuesday blasted Bolton in an op-ed in Rare as “a longtime member of the failed Washington elite that Trump vowed to oppose.” Others, however, have defended Bolton. Eliot Cohen, a former Bush State Department senior adviser, tweeted late Tuesday that Bolton “would be a capable Secretary of State — experienced & tough.” Then again, what Cohen thinks does not matter: he is perhaps the most visible foreign policy establishment type who has been critical of Trump’s transition. He said this week that he had been asked by a friend in Trump’s orbit to submit names of people in the establishment who might want to serve. Cohen told his friend that those skeptical of Trump would want to know who was leading his administration on foreign policy. When Cohen grew critical of those questions, he wrote a biting op-ed in The Washington Post advising people to not work for Trump, at least for the time being. “At the very least, they should wait to see who gets the top jobs. Until then, let the Trump team fill the deputy assistant secretary and assistant secretary jobs with civil servants, retired military officers and diplomats, or the large supply of loyal or obsequious second-raters who will be eager to serve,” he wrote. Some saw the op-ed as good news, believing it signified a radical turn by Trump from a foreign party establishment that should be ignored. “The first encouraging news I've heard in days. If a leader of #NeverTrump is saying this, that means the establishment hasn't won. Yet,” said Christopher Preble of the CATO Institute. However, neo-cons are bad at losing, so they have redoubled efforts to land one of their own next to Trump. Lindsey Graham, a prominent foreign policy hawk in the Senate, issued an endorsement of Bolton on Thursday, saying: ""He understands who our friends and enemies are. We see the world in very similar ways."" He also slammed Paul's criticism of Bolton: “You could put the number of Republicans who will follow Rand Paul’s advice on national security in a very small car. Rand is my friend but he’s a libertarian and an outlier in the party on these issues."" Funny, that's exactly what the experts said about Trump's chances of winning not even two weeks ago. Meanwhile, the biggest warmonger, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, who has not said who he'd like to see in Trump's cabinet, laid down a marker on Tuesday by warning the future Trump administration against trying to seek an improved relationship with adversary Russia. “When America has been at its greatest, it is when we have stood on the side those fighting tyranny. That is where we must stand again,” he warned. Luckily, McCain - whose relationship with Trump has been at rock bottom ever since Trump's first appearance in the presidential campaign - has zero impact on the thinking of Trump. Furthermore, speaking of Russia, Retired Amy Col. Andrew Bacevich said there needs to be a rethink of American foreign policy. He said the US must consider whether Saudi Arabia and Pakistan qualify as US allies, and the growing divergence between the US and Israel. “The establishment doesn't want to touch questions like these with a ten foot pole,” he said at a conference on Tuesday hosted by The American Conservative, the Charles Koch Institute, and the George Washington University Department of Political Science. Furthermore, resetting the ""deplorable"" relations with Russia is a necessary if not sufficient condition to halt the incipient nuclear arms build up that has resulted of the recent dramatic return of the Cold War. As such, a Trump presidency while potentially a failure, may be best remember for avoiding the launch of World War III. If, that is, he manages to prevent the influence of neo-cons in his cabinet. And then there are the wildcards: those Trump advisers who are difficult to peg into which camp they fall into. One example is retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, who was selected by Trump as his national security adviser. Flynn is a “curious case,” said Daniel Larison, senior editor at The American Conservative. The retired Army general has said he wants to work with Russia, but also expressed contrary views in his book ""Field of Fight."" According to Larison, Flynn writes of an “enemy alliance” against the US that includes Russia, North Korea, China, Iran, Syria, Cuba, Bolivia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, al-Qaida, Hezbollah, and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. From that standpoint, he is about as ""establishment"" as they come. It's also not crystal clear which camp Giuliani falls into. The former mayor is known as a fierce critic of Islamic extremism but has scant foreign policy experience. Most say what is likely is change. “Change is coming to American grand strategy whether we like it or not,’ said Christopher Layne, Robert M. Gates Chair in National Security at Texas A&M University. “I think we are overdue for American retrenchment. Americans are beginning to suffer from hegemony fatigue,” he said. And, let's not forget, the tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children who are droned to death every year by anonymous remote-control operators in the US just so the US can pursue its global hegemonic interest.They most certainly have, and unless something indeed changes, will continue to suffer, leading to even more resentment against the US, and even more attacks against US citizens around the globe, and on US soil. Some call them terrorism, others call them retaliation. Reprinted with permission from ZeroHedge . Related",1

42830,U.S. agency to help Iraq recover from IS despite Trump aid cuts,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The United States is committed to helping Iraq recover from three years of war against Islamic State despite President Donald Trump cutting the foreign aid budget, a senior official in its main government aid agency has said. Thomas Staal, the Counselor of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), said the agency would continue to provide basic humanitarian services and additional support for minority groups such as psychosocial support to those who suffered genocide, slavery, and gender-based violence.  The budget that the president submitted included a 30 percent cut, but for Iraq actually we are looking at additional funding, especially for the victims of Islamic State,  Staal told Reuters in an interview at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Trump staked out his position on foreign aid on the campaign trail, casting it as a waste of U.S. tax dollars. The White House proposed slashing the budget for foreign aid by a third. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared final victory over Islamic State on Saturday after Iraqi forces drove the last remnants of the group from the country, three years after the militants captured about a third of Iraq s territory. The war has had a devastating impact on the areas previously controlled by the militants. About 3.2 million people remain displaced, the United Nations says.  The last estimate by Abadi put the cost of post-war reconstruction at $50 billion, a figure calculated before Iraqi forces retook Mosul, which severely damaged the biggest city in northern Iraq. The U.S. government has provided nearly $1.7 billion in humanitarian assistance for Iraq since the Islamic State takeover of the north in 2014, Staal said. That includes a total of $265 million donated to the United Nations Development Programme s Iraq stabilization fund in 2016 and 2017. USAID has asked UNDP to focus on the minority areas, said Staal, who met with Christian and Yazidi leaders during a five-day visit to Iraq.  The primary request from everybody was security,  said Staal, who also met with two young women who were sold into slavery by Islamic State fighters. In 2014, more than 3,000 Yezidis were killed by Islamic State in what the United Nations described as a genocidal campaign. Others were sold into sexual slavery or forced to fight. Iraq is exempted from Trump s policy of cutting aid because of the especially  terrible plight  experienced by Islamic State s victims, Staal said, but it was a short term focus.  The long term solution is that the Iraqi government is going to have to provide services to people in a more effective, efficient way,  he said. USAID is working directly with Iraqi ministries to train staff and improve efficiency, with procurement reform high up on the agenda, Staal said.  Corruption is rife in all levels of government in Iraq, which in 2016 ranked 166 out of 176 countries in Transparency International s Corruption Perception Index. Abadi has repeatedly said that once Islamic State was beaten, fighting corruption would be his next focus. (The story was refiled to fix a typo in paragraph 2) ",0
19440,Indiana Economy Offers Caution and Inspiration as Primary Nears - The New York Times,"INDIANAPOLIS  —   As the presidential race came to Indiana, candidates of both parties seized on a fresh example in this industrial state of factory jobs being shipped abroad. “Is anyone here from Carrier?” Donald J. Trump called out in Evansville, Ind. last week, referring to the Carrier Corporation’s closing of factories that make heating and   units. “They let go of 1, 400 people to move to Mexico,” Mr. Trump said. “And you know what? They have to pay a consequence. ” At a union rally the next day at the State Capitol, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont thundered a message to the chief executive of United Technologies, Carrier’s parent company. “Stop the greed,” he shouted. “Stop destroying the middle class in America! Respect your workers!” The picture of manufacturing decline and   retreat has become a driving narrative of the presidential race, spawning economic populism on both the left and the right. Yet Indiana, which holds its primary on Tuesday, defies an easy picture of Rust Belt decline. By many measures, the state is humming economically, offering a contrarian reality to the gloomy scenario that the presidential candidates are presenting to motivate voters. With nearly one in five jobs in manufacturing, the highest share of any state, Indiana’s gross domestic product is accelerating faster than any of its Great Lakes neighbors, according to the latest figures from the Commerce Department. Unemployment at the end of last year was 4. 4 percent, below the national average of about  5 percent. Even though the figure has ticked up in 2016, economists attribute the increase to the large number of people returning to the work force, including job seekers moving to Indiana. Factories in heavily industrial Elkhart County, a center of recreational vehicle manufacturing where unemployment has been significantly reduced, have resorted to calling a homeless shelter to look for workers. The Indianapolis region is growing faster than Chicago, Cleveland or Detroit, and personal income statewide rose 3. 6 percent last year, faster than the national average. “The economy here in terms of the data is as good as it’s been in a generation,” said Michael J. Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind. Mr. Hicks said that if measured by the value of goods produced, manufacturing has never been stronger in Indiana. The boom in the auto industry has played a big role in this because of the many parts factories in the state. Factory jobs have declined, he added, but not because of trade deals with other countries as Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders assert, but because Indiana factories are increasingly efficient and fewer workers are needed. “Manufacturing employment peaked in 1973,” he said, adding that since then the productivity of Indiana factory workers has climbed 250 percent. “We need far fewer workers, and a very different type of worker, too. ” In Warsaw, Ind. for example, a global center for manufacturing orthopedic devices, the workers are highly specialized. Despite increases in productivity, wages have stagnated in step with national trends, feeding widespread anxiety about the future. Candidates in both parties have channeled these fears at targets ranging from immigration to trade deals to the government. And Indiana economists point to pockets of weakness within the state. Like other Midwestern states, Indiana’s rural counties are emptying: Of the state’s 92 counties, 54 lost population in 2015, according to the Business Research Center at Indiana University. “Connersville in Fayette County, which was once called Little Detroit, they had close to 2, 000 manufacturing jobs and now are down to about 400,” said Timothy Slaper, an economist at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business. Patti and Richard Schwalm, owners of a machine shop in rural Henry County, an hour’s drive east of Indianapolis, said they had to cut their staff to three employees in recent years. They blamed President Obama for hurting the manufacturers that are their clients. The Schwalms plan to vote for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Republican primary. Pressed for details about Obama administration policies that hurt manufacturing, Ms. Schwalm acknowledged, “The problems we have are 50 years in the making. ” Todd Witte, who works in a factory in Fort Wayne, Ind. plans to vote on Tuesday for Mr. Sanders because of the senator’s opposition to trade deals and his history of walking union picket lines. If Mr. Sanders is not the Democratic nominee, Mr. Witte said, he will probably vote for Mr. Trump if he is nominated. “I like his views on the Second Amendment,” he said. “In our local, they’re either Bernie Sanders or Trump supporters. ” Mr. Witte was in attendance on Friday when Mr. Sanders addressed members of his union, the United Steelworkers, who were protesting the Carrier layoffs. Even as Mr. Sanders delivered a   speech about the cost of trade deals, many union members in the crowd who did not work for Carrier said they were personally doing fine. Mr. Witte’s plant, owned by Dana Holding Corporation, plans to grow to 900 hourly workers from 535 in the next few years, according to Tom Herendeen, president of the United Steelworkers Local 903, who also attended the rally. “We’re doing great,” he said. “We have a lot of new business coming in. ” Carrier’s decision to lay off 2, 100 workers at two factories gained national attention in February when a video of an executive icily delivering the news to workers generated more 3. 5 million views. Mr. Trump took to criticizing the company and threatening high tariffs that he promised would force Carrier to reverse itself. “They’re going to call me and say, ‘Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana,’” he told the crowd. His protectionist policies, which go against decades of Republican orthodoxy, have brought the issue of trade and its potential costs to workers to the fore of the presidential race. Hillary Clinton has backed off her earlier support of the   Partnership deal, and during a visit here she vowed to take on China for dumping steel. Because the loss of manufacturing jobs has many factors and predates the latest international trade deals and the rise of China, economists say that steep new tariffs, such as those promised by Mr. Trump, will not restore jobs. Mr. Hicks, the Ball State economist, predicted that Indiana will have 125, 000 new openings in manufacturing jobs, in part because of retirements, each year in the next decade. “By way of comparison,” he wrote in a blog post, “we will only have 70, 000 high school graduates per year. ”",0
67433,Idols of Intellectual Perversity: How Ideology Corrupts the Minds of Smart People,"By Jonas E. Alexis on November 1, 2016 The good thing about morality or practical reason is that it doesn’t have a particular political affiliation. It transcends political ideologies and that’s what make things very interesting. …by Jonas E. Alexis 

You’ve probably seen Megyn Kelly in action. You’ve probably watched her babbling weird things, crazy things, and incoherent things. You’ve also seen how she has prostrated before the Powers That Be for money, power, and fame. [1] In fact, she has been seeking for a salary of $20 million with Fox News. [2] 
In other words, Kelly is selling herself for the almighty dollar. If you haven’t noticed some of those phenomena, here is Kelly on the Howard Stern show talking about her husband’s genital, frolicking and other delicate things: YouTube - Veterans Today - 
For Kelly, it is perfectly fine for Howard Stern to talk about those issues on his show. It is also fine for Stern to sexually degrade Kelly. For Kelly, Stern is obviously doing a great job. 
But for people like Donald Trump to mention almost the same things on a private bus is an unpardonable sin. Sure, Trump’s remarks are disgusting and nasty. And there is no way to justify his immoral statement. It could even be conceived that Trump is just a nasty person who has been grabbing women, well, “by the pussy.” 
But do we honestly think that Trump is the only nasty and disgusting guy in town? Can Kelly really explain to us what was she doing on the Howard Stern Show about six years ago? And how again can the same sex culture itself slam Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” phraseology and at the same time praise people like Wilhelm Reich or even Alfred Kinsey? 
You see, the good thing about morality or practical reason is that it doesn’t have a particular political affiliation. It transcends political ideologies and that’s what make things very interesting. If you are looking at things from a moral point of view, then those who are condemning Trump ought to condemn the same sex culture which articulates Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” in a much subtle and interesting way. 
Keep in mind that Wilhelm Reich, the man who coined the term “the sexual revolution,” was praised by the New York Times and other media outlets. Reich explicitly promoted and encouraged the sexualization of children and the clergy in his widely read text The Mass Psychology of Fascism . [3] 
Reich taught that “Sexual inhibition prevents the average adolescent from thinking and feeling in a rational way.” [4] Reich didn’t stop there. He’s got more insights: “If one succeeds in getting rid of the childhood fear of masturbation and as a result thereof genitality demands gratification, then intellectual insight and sexual gratification are wont to prevail.” [5] 
Then, Reich dropped the ideological bomb: “The mechanism that makes masses of people incapable of freedom is the social suppression of genital sexuality in small children, adolescents, and adults.” [6] 
Now we’re talking. Now things get really delicious. And it is here that our story gets very interesting because again Reich, like his contemporary Alfred Kinsey, was never condemned for his immoral posturing. The sex culture gave both men great accolades for spreading their own version of “democracy” and “freedom” and for polluting the social order. 
Kinsey, for his part, published “academic” books such as Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female , in which he forged data, pulled things out of thin air, [7] and deliberately selected samples of his “research” from male and female prostitutes to advance his wicked ideology. 
Kinsey’s other methods were so bias and fraudulent that statistician John Tukey of the American Statistical Association declared then that “A random selection of three people would have been better than a group of 300 chosen by Mr. Kinsey.” [8] 
Academic institutions such as Indiana University continue to protect Kinsey’s pedophilia. [9] Paul Gebhard, Kinsey’s protégé and former director of the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research, deliberately removed anything from the Institute that would even remotely implicate Kinsey as a pedophile and not a scientist. 
So, isn’t there a logical breakdown here? The sex industry complicated things when its advocates fired people for exposing Kinsey and documenting his immoral behavior. Are thing living in contradiction? 
Indeed. 
Now were are learning that the children of the same sex industry are implicitly sneaking in or even adopting moral themes by saying that “grab them by the pussy” is universally wrong. The sex industry shows that G. K. Chesterton was right all along when he said: “A man must be something of a moralist if he is to preach, even if he is to preach unmorality.” [10] 
Perhaps this was one reason Kinsey died “a broken man” [11] in 1956. A sodomite and sadomasochist of the highest rank, Kinsey is indirectly the father of what is now “sex education.” 
Kinsey’s Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female contain chapter after chapter about pedophilia, group sex, orgies, etc. Kinsey was trained as a biologist, and it was no accident that he used his training to promote social engineering. [12] 
Obviously the ideology upon which the sex industry is based is irrational, incoherent, and ultimately worthless. And if had had to give the sex industry a different name from a book, it would be Smeagol, who later changed to Gollum, from J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings . Gollum is the actual character who loves and hates the ring of power at the same time, “as he loves and hates himself.” 
In a similar way, the sex industry hates morality and fights against it in the cultural landscape, but the same industry always appeals to an implicitly moral code when someone else pursuits an immoral life. Hillary for example supported the Trotskyite group the Pussy Riot , a subversive band whose members deliberately performed orgies at a museum. 
But the same Hillary finds Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” disgusting. Trump is nasty for calling people overweight, but Hillary herself called people out for their weight and even went so far as to say that they are “shit-kickers.” [13] 
Sometimes, a “good morning, Mrs. Clinton” could drive her to say: “Fuck off! It’s enough that I have to see you shit-kickers every day…Do your goddamn job and keep your mouth shut.” [14] Judith Reisman 
There is more here than meets the eye and ear . Judith Reisman was inevitably fired at the American University for meticulously and methodically documenting that Kinsey was a pedophile masquerading as a researcher. 
Reisman, who has graciously sent me a copy of the fourth edition of her book, Stolen Honor Stolen Innocence: How America was Betrayed by the Lies and Sexual Crimes of a Mad “Scientist,” writes that Kinsey was “familiar with the work of Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld. Kinsey’s friend, Dr. Harry Benjamin, had brought Hirschfeld to America to speak against the social reform accomplishments of the Purity Movement.“ [15] 
Magnus Hirschfeld (1868-1935), a German-Jewish physician and sexologist, used his medical training as a pretext to promote perversion and, in 1897, built his own system of “the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, the first organization anywhere devoted to the protection of homosexual rights.” 
Hirschfeld was also “the primary inventor of marriage counseling, Gay Liberation, artificial insemination, surgical gender ‘reassignment,’ and modern sex therapy…His goofy persona and conscientiousness transformed Sexology from an anthropological curiosity into a popular German science. The Berlin monthlies, starting in the mid-twenties, referred to Hirschfeld solicitously as ‘the Einstein of Sex.” [16] 
Hirschfeld was the Einstein of sex because he “embraced a doctrine known as ‘sexual relativity.” [17] While the moral order dictates that there are only two sexes—male and female—Hirscheld postulated another doctrine, one more congruent with his subversive ideology. Hirschfeld “wrote that it was ‘unscientific’ to speak of two sexes. Between ‘full man’ and ‘full woman’ was an infinite string of sexual/gender possibilities.” [18] 
The only force that could hinder Hirschfeld was the moral order and a will to act on it, but he attacked it before proceeding with his sexual revolution. [19] Hirschfeld spent a large part of his 1200-page book The Homosexuality of Men and Women deconstructing moral principles about sex. [20] 
This began to take place in 1919 when Hirschfeld opened the Institute of Sexology in Berlin. Jewish scholar Mel Gordon of the University of California tells us that the institution 
“quickly became one of the city’s most curious attractions. The Institute’s buildings, including a former mansion, were divided into areas for lectures, consulting offices, study rooms, laboratories, medical clinics, and a museum space devoted to sexual pathology.” [21] 
Paul Johnson commented, 
“The Foxtrot and short skirts, the addiction of pleasure in ‘the imperial sewers of Berlin,’ the ‘dirty pictures’ of sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld or the typical man of the times took on in the minds of the average citizen a repugnance that is difficult to recall in hindsight without some historical effort. 
“In a number of highly celebrated provocations, the stage of the ‘20s dealt with topics like patricide, incest and other crimes and the deepest inclination of the times tended to self-mockery.” [22] 
A number of Jewish icons such as George Gershwin, Ben Hecht, Douglas Fairbanks, and Sergei Eisenstein visited the school. [23] Eisenstein “enjoyed the Institute’s collection of sailor-dolls—homemade paper toys that German homosexuals fashioned during the Great War.” [24] 
The library of the school, “which contained the largest sex and pornographic book collection in Europe, remained accessible to all readers…Politically, the Institute provided a forum for progressive lawyers and government officials who sought to eradicate the laws against homosexuality and defend Germany’s legal abortion rights from the growing onslaught of fascist and religious parties.” [25] 
The building contained all sort of sexual devices in order to advance the sexual revolution in Berlin. Mel Gordon again writes: 
“Glass cases of fetishistic objects and sex aids from preliterate, Asian, and European cultures filled two other rooms. In the open counters and boxes were collections of Mandigo dildos that squirted a milky solution, Moche water bottles with penis-shaped spouts, Sanskrit sex manuals, miniature shoes worn by bound-foot Chinese courtesans, medieval chastity belts, torture instruments from a German brothel, sadistic drawings and assemblages created by Lustmord convicts, an entire picture window of ankle boots donated by a local fetishist, antique steam-driven vibrators, fake rubber breasts and vaginas taken from transvestite prostitutes, lacy panties found on the corpses of von Hindenburg’s heroic officers, and other such incontrovertible evidence of Hirschfeld’s new calculus of desire.” [26] 
Magus Hirschfeld left Germany during the rise of the Nazi Party, never to return. But he obviously had a tremendously powerful influence on Alfred Kinsey , who went on to open his own “sex research” at Indiana University, which was partly based on Hirschefeld’s questionnaires. [27] According to Kinsey, things such as child pornography, bestiality and even sex among children are natural and should be encouraged and promoted. Kinsey wrote: “It is difficult to understand why a child, except for its cultural conditioning, should be disturbed at having its genitalia touched, or disturbed at seeing the genitalia of other persons, or disturbed at even more specific sexual contacts.” [28] 
How did Kinsey bring this repulsive idea to the public, and who was he following? Reisman points out that Kinsey was an admirer and part-time disciple of the late Satanist Aleister Crowley, commonly known as “The Beast.” In fact, Kinsey made every effort “to acquire Aleister Crowley’s diaries for the Institute” at Indiana University. [29] He actually failed. 
But failure was obviously not an option for Kinsey, as he went on to perform the same sex and Satanic orgies that Crowley himself performed. Kinsey “made a pilgrimage to Thelema Abbey, the temple where Crowley had ministered. Crowley’s first book, the pornographic White Stains, advocated sexual magic and was much favored by Kinsey. In fact, Kinsey was photographed in Crowley’s “Chamber of Horrors,” while he and Clara appear together in a photo following Kinsey’s return from the Abbey.” [30] 
Kenneth Anger, a Crowley devotee, later admitted that Kinsey’s obsession with perversion was “highly reminiscent” of Crowley’s sex magic. [31] When Kinsey visited what one ought to call Crowley’s lab experiment in Italy at the Abbey, he saw depictions of children in “sado-sexual ceremonies,” and Kinsey never condemned the act. Kinsey “found Crowley’s savage child pornography, his homosexual magic, and his human sacrifice records to be ‘most open.’” [32] 
We are now facing an inevitable conclusion. No one with an ounce of moral sense should applaud Donald Trump for uttering disgusting words about women. But will the same mass media devote the same amount of time to dethrone people like Hugh Hefner, who incidentally articulated the same thing that Trump was saying? Hefner declared: “Censorship is the tool of totalitarianism and repression. If it is used today to prohibit sexually explicit words and images, it might be used tomorrow to prohibit other forms of expression. “It might be used to justify the oppression of women in such areas as abortion rights, and to foil other efforts to bring about equality between the sexes. Censorship is insatiable. “It can erode the freedom of expression until there is only one acceptable point of view left. If that were to happen in our society, whose point of view would survive? “Playboy celebrates sex because sex is one of the good things in life. The freedom to express oneself without fear of censorship is another.” [33] 
Here’s the kicker: Hefner wrote his piece in the L.A. Times , the same organ that is now condemning Trump for following Hefner’s advice! 
What the sex culture is basically saying here is that it is sexually permissible to “grab them by the pussy.” After all, “Censorship is the tool of totalitarianism and repression.” But when Trump actually grabs them “by the pussy,” what was sexually permissible has magically become morally impermissible. 
If these people cannot see the lunacy of their ideology, then I’ve got some hamsters to sell them in South Korea.

52888, WATCH: Bill Nye Predicts ‘Big Trouble’ After Trump Silences Government Scientists,"Donald Trump s war on science drew a response from  The Science Guy  on Saturday morning.Trump and his team of minions are trying to stop scientists from doing research and sharing the results with the public.From the Environmental Protection Agency to the Department of Energy, Trump is systematically dismantling critical research and testing that helps citizens and businesses make decisions and keeps us safe.Trump is halting water and air quality tests along with climate change research, all of which could mean the difference between life and death for millions of Americans as Trump moves to approve oil drilling and pipelines and doubles down on coal instead of clean energy sources that will cut pollution and slow the effects of climate change.Rather than accept real facts, Trump and his team are touting what they call  alternative facts.  Trump and conservatives are living in a delusional world where facts don t matter because they directly contradict their own worldview.During a discussion with Joy Reid, Nye explained why Trump s rejection of facts is going to take years to reverse and that it will spell  big trouble  for our nation and the world. Well, any time you re burning fossil fuels, you authorize more pipelines, you re headed for trouble in the big picture. But in the bigger picture is this thing, you know, this word we love,  cognitive dissonance,  this phrase. You have a worldview that disagrees with what you observe. So you might expect, if you were as open-minded as a scientist, as a scientifically-literate voter or taxpayer, you might expect that data would change your mind   but that s not how people are.People on either side, the other side and this side, you double down when you find conflict, it s called the  Backfire Effect,  it backfires, and you get more entrenched in your worldview. For example, if somebody believes in astrology, it takes them about two years to get over it. You have to show them over and over there s no such thing as astrology, it doesn t really work, and then they let go. But everybody s expectation that you ll let go in a week is not going to be met.So our problem, everybody, is this doubling down, this backfire effect. So we have to work, I think, diligently in the science community to fight back. Of course there are the facts, we start with those. But there s this human nature thing on both sides to fight back. We have our bubble over here, they have their bubble over there. Here s the video via VidMe:Shutting down our scientists puts Americans in danger. We can no longer keep our environment safe if they can not do their jobs and tell us the information we need to know. Increased mining and drilling will end up poisoning our lands and water supply and increase the effects of climate change. Trump s denial of basic facts is going to get Americans killed and that blood will be on his hands and he should be held accountable for it.Featured image via screenshot",1
67064,French foreign minister in Libya to push peace deal,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - France s Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian was in Libya on Monday to meet rival political leaders and offer support for a deal aimed at stabilizing the strifetorn North African country. Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Seraj and the divided nation s eastern commander Khalifa Haftar signed an agreement in Paris in July committing them to a conditional ceasefire and to work toward elections in 2018. The deal did not include other key factions. Western governments, worried about Islamist militants and smugglers thriving in Libya s chaos, are pushing a broader U.N.-backed deal to unify Libya and end the instability that has weakened the country since the 2011 fall of Muammar Gaddafi. In Tripoli, Le Drian met Seraj and planned to hold talks with Abdulrahman Swehli, a politician connected to some of Haftar s rivals who heads a parliamentary council in the capital, Libyan officials said.  Le Drian was also to visit Misrata, Swehli s home city and a base of opposition to Haftar, before heading to Benghazi to meet Haftar and to Tobruk to meet the head of an eastern-based parliament aligned with him.  The minister wants to consolidate this agreement by getting the parties not invited in July to support it,  said a French diplomatic source.  He wants to ensure that everyone is playing the game and lay the groundwork for elections.  The French minister s visit is in line with President Emmanuel Macron s push for a deeper French role in bringing Libyan factions together in the hope of countering militant violence and easing Europe s migrant crisis.  Our objective is the stabilization of Libya in the interests of the Libyans themselves,  Le Drian said in a statement in Tripoli.  A united Libya, equipped with functioning institutions, is the condition for avoiding the terrorist threat in the long term.  He said the Paris deal was meant to support the U.N.-backed accord for a government of national unity. Le Drian met U.N. special envoy Ghassan Salame on Sunday. The French diplomatic source said the visit would fit into efforts by Salame to announce a road map to elections during the coming U.N. General Assembly.  Seraj and Haftar clearly want to measure themselves in elections,  the source said.  Libya would likely need to agree on a new constitution or electoral law before elections, which will be a difficult task for the country s divided institutions. Organizing polls would also involve big logistical and security challenges.  Past Western attempts to broker agreements have often fallen victim to political infighting among rival factions and armed brigades vying for power in the OPEC oil producer. Seraj s government has struggled to impose control and its presidential council is divided. Haftar has refused to accept its legitimacy. He has been gaining ground, backed by allies Egypt and United Arab Emirates.   The ceasefire between non-terrorist elements is in general respected,  the French diplomatic source said.  Haftar s advances are accompanied by a strengthening of Seraj in the west so it s creating a fragile balance that encourages a compromise.  ",0
43729,Baba Vanga Was Right About Obama's Presidency And The 9/11 Attacks Sees Dire Future For Trump And The US,"The Blind Prophetess claims Barrack Obama will be the last president of the United States.

Baba Vagan is a cult figure in some circles in the Balkan states because of her uncanny knack for making astonishingly accurate predictions about the future.


Baba Vagan, who is sometimes referred to as the blind prophetess, is credited with predicting the events of September 11th, 2001 in the 1980s. It has been said that she had a vision of ‘American brethren’ being attacked by two steel birds which some believe could have symbolised the two hijacked jet planes which smashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre complex.

Perhaps even more impressively, she also made a prediction that the 44th President of the United States would be an African-American. However, unfortunately for the controversial president-elect Donald Trump, Vagan has said that Barrack Obama would be the last president that America would ever have and that Trump will never actually come to power. Extrapolating from this, supporters of Vagan have suggested that something catastrophic will happen to American civilisation in the space of the next two months and that the ramifications will be so deep that it would irrevocably abolish the office of the presidency. Others have suggested that it means that Trump will eschew the title and role of ‘president’ and instead install himself as a permanent dictator of the United States . 

It has been estimated that 85% of Baba Vagan’s prophecies have come to pass. However, sceptics have suggested that her prophecies are so vague that she is credited with being accurate more often than is reasonable. Her supporters have also been criticised for making fraudulent claims about her powers of psychic deduction.

However, for those who are inclined to find out more about the mysterious blind prophetess it may be of interest to know about some of her other predictions for the future. Vagan believes that human beings will have established cities under the oceans in 2130, that there will be a war on Mars in the year 3000 and by 3797 the Earth will be destroyed, but humanity will survive after fleeing to another universe.

12570,[VIDEO] BALTIMORE MAYOR TO POLICE: “Let them loot…it’s only property” Police Demoralized After Being Unable To Respond To 9-11 Calls From Terrorized Business Owners,"The radical Baltimore mayor who ordered the Baltimore Police Department to stand down is now calling for a federal investigation into the Baltimore Police Department. What about a federal investigation into her reckless actions that were clearly motivated by her desire to side with the rioters?? Are we living in some alternate universe where all ability to reason and to use common sense has been removed from our society?Baltimore s streets will likely take years   if not decades   to recover after April s riots that left scores of business owners devastated and local police disheartened. Many cops feel  demoralized, hung out to dry and abandoned,  Fox News  Leland Vittert reported on  Hannity  Monday. There s a sentiment here of  why bother showing up?  Vittert added. Vittert was on the scene at what used to be  ground zero  for the rioting and said he had not seen a single police car during the time he was there. The area is known for drug dealings and gang activity, according to Vittert. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said more than 200 businesses were destroyed in the riots, Fox reported.  So this was your life savings you put into this?  Vittert asked a business owner whose property was destroyed. Exactly, exactly,  the business owner said. He added that his life s work was demolished in 30 minutes by looters and vandals resulting in more than $30,000 worth of damage. Vitter talked to a pharmacy owner who said 99 percent of his store s shelves were ransacked and fears the prescription drugs are now out on the streets.  There were dozens of businesses that were looted, and what was stunning to the business owners themselves is as the looting was going on, they were calling 911,  Vittert said. And, as we have reported, the police did nothing because they had an order from the mayor to  let them loot. It s only property.  Business owners are now faced with the difficult decision of whether to rebuild as they worry they will not be protected from future crime and violence.Via: BizPacReview",1
13272,Report Exposes Inner Workings of Facebook and How Clinton Loyalists Control Your Newsfeed,"posted by Eddie Censorship by Facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press — for instance, sentiments not praising Hillary Clinton — and now, through both a new report from Reuters and emails published by Wikileaks, we have insight into why certain posts are targeted. Facebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive, violent, or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards — but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts, pages, and groups are made remains unknown. And Facebook takedowns, no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make, have been no less controversial or questionable — and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case. Recent examples of head-scratchers which led to an international uproar, include Facebook’s removal of the iconic Vietnam War photograph of Phan Thị Kim Phúc — who, at just 9-years-old, was captured on film by an Associated Press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a Buddhist pagoda in the village of Trang Bang. That photograph helped cement in the collective American mind the horrors of the war, and ultimately fueled the success of the anti-war effort — but Facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity — and proceeded even to ban the page of the Conservative prime minister of Norway for also posting the image. Ultimately, the social media company reversed course in that case — but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader Rosa Park’s arrest. But taking down of the image of Kim Phúc might not have been simply an error of AI, since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal, two unnamed former Facebook employees told Reuters . “Trainers told content-monitoring staffers that the photo violated Facebook policy, despite its historical significance, because it depicted a naked child, in distress, photographed without her consent, the employees told Reuters.” In the final decision to reverse that censorship, Facebook head of the community operations division, Justin Osofsky, admitted it had been a “mistake.” According to Reuters , to whom many current and former Facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity, the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will, in certain instances, be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the company’s elite executives. In addition to Osofsky, Global Policy Chief Monika Bickert; government relations chief, Joel Kaplan; vice president for public policy and communications, Elliot Schrage; and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg make the final call on censorship and appeals. “All five studied at Harvard, and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution. All but Sandberg hold law degrees. Three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to Sandberg,” the outlet notes. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions. But there are others. Company spokeswoman Christine Chen explained, “Facebook has a broad, diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement, with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand.” For those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship, recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by. Often, the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors. Indeed, and once again flaring international controversy, Facebook disabled , among others, the accounts of editors of Quds and Shehab New Agency — prominent Palestinian media organizations — without explanation or even a specific example given for justification. Although three of four Palestinian-focused accounts were restored, Facebook refused to comment to either Reuters or the accounts’ owners why the decision was reversed, except to say it had been an ‘error.’ In fact, although Chen and other Facebook insiders spoke with Reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures, many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences. Earlier this year, an exposé by Gizmodo showing Facebook’s suppression of conservative outlets via its “Trending Topics” section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays. Alternative media, too, which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm, has often been the subject of controversial take-downs, censorship, and suppressive tactics — either directly by Facebook, or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots. However, considering Sheryl Sandberg and her loyalists populate the top-level group deciding the fate for content removal complaints, it would appear Wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred, left-leaning narrative. In a June 4, 2015, email to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta — an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by Wikileaks — penned by Sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband, states , in part, “And I still want HRC to win badly. I am still here to help as I can. She came over and was magical with my kids.” After a wave of post removals and temporary page bans, it appears Facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards — and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives. Senior members of Facebook’s policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards, which — though welcome — might only provide temporary relief. Quoted by the Wall Street Journal , they wrote : “In the weeks ahead, we’re going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy, significant, or important to the public interest—even if they might otherwise violate our standards.” While the social media giant deems itself a technology, and not news, platform, Facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users. Although it perhaps has some responsibility in regard to the removal of certain content, putting censorship in the hands of only a few individuals in certain instances is a chilling reminder of the fragility — and grave importance — of free speech. source:",1

But I, as a person, am not illegal.” [Video]","Tucker Carlson interviews Jose Antonio Vargas, CEO of Define America He gave Vargas a reality check!Vargas takes offense to the way Carlson is framing this? It s difficult for this illegal to face reality.He says,  I was an undocumented immigrant in this country  yet he doesn t think he s illegal.Vargas:  My protest yesterday was as an undocumented immigrant, one of 11 million who are viewed as criminals,  let s pause here for a moment . . . that is one illegal immigrant too many and you ARE criminals . . . now we ll continue,  my own way of protesting was just   actually   very quietly and respectfully thinking about what it means to be an immigrant in the Trump era, right? So that, that, that was my way,  he stutters on smugly.Tucker replied,  Okay, well thank you for not breaking anything . . . I m not accusing you of setting fires, I m merely saying: where are people who agree with these folks standing up and saying  you re not allowed to do this, you can t block traffic, you can t break things, you can t set fires , it  pretty simple. Vargas replies,  This issue is not just quote-un-quote political, it s personal   we re talking about millions of people who are related to undocumented people that you call  criminal illegals  everyday, right?  Tucker aptly jumps in and asks of Vargas,  What should I call people who are here illegally? Should I pretend they re not here illegally?

64752," Trump Didn’t Want These Secrets To Get Out, But A Judge Just Said ‘No’","Donald Trump has been trying to suppress internal documents from his controversial Trump University business, but a judge has just ruled that they must be released into the public domain.The Friday ruling, in which Judge Gonzalo Curiel cited heightened public interest in presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, was issued in response to a request by The Washington Post. The ruling was a setback for Trump, whose attorneys argued that the documents contained trade secrets.Curiel s order came the same day that Trump railed against the judge at a boisterous San Diego rally for his handling of the case, in which students have alleged they were misled and defrauded. The trial is set for November.The documents reportedly contain information on how Trump University advised its employees on how to squeeze the most money from students who had signed up for information on building their own real estate business. Trump University has been criticized by former students and investigators like the Attorney general for New York for trying to make money from people desperate to be entrepreneurs, when in fact much of the material they received was worthless.Trump University students have previously said they were constantly upsold new material, while rarely making the kind of money that was promised in ads featuring Trump and his personal branding.On Friday, Trump included an attack on the judge in the Trump University case in his remarks at a campaign rally. He described the judge as a  Mexican,  when in reality he is a U.S. citizen.Trump University is among the many failed businesses Trump has been involved in over the years. Other companies that failed include Trump Steaks, Trump Air, and Trump Magazine. Trump s business and casinos have filed for bankruptcy several times. Yet despite these failures, Trump has regularly presented himself as a  winner  who is unfamiliar with losing.Featured image via Flickr",1
45969, Trump Campaign Official Tries To Make Dallas Shootings All About Hillary Clinton,"Virginia s Trump campaign chairman politicized the Dallas shootings in one of the worst ways imaginable. He didn t use it to call for more guns on the streets. He didn t use it to claim reverse racism. He tried to make it all about the 2016 election and Hillary Clinton, and it s really sick.Corey Stewart said, in a post that s since been deleted:Like Joe Effing Walsh, Stuart has forgotten that the Internet never forgets, and this will follow him and King Donnie for awhile, despite spokeswoman Hope Hicks  attempt to mitigate fallout from this: Corey does not speak for the campaign and this is not something we agree with. The vice president of Trump s Virginia campaign, John Fredericks, echoed that empty sentiment with an empty sentiment of his own: That statement by Corey Stewart is his and his alone. Oh, really? They better tell that to their overlord. While Donald the Trump didn t come right out and blame Hillary for the deaths of those officers like Stewart did, he did go after her for taking  softball questions  about her emails on CNN on a day of national tragedy. Because Hillary can totally control what CNN decides to ask her:Isn t it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on @CNN?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 8, 2016Isn t it sad that on a day of national tragedy Donald Trump and his campaign decide to make the whole thing all about Hillary? This is how you politicize a tragedy   by bringing up your opponent in a damned political race and using the tragedy to attack them.It is truly hypocritical that our wannabe White-Supremacist-in-Chief would say something like that when he and one of his campaign officials are busy politicizing all of this in the sickest way imaginable. Calling for more  good guys with guns  would be less political than this. It just goes to prove that all Trump really cares about his himself and his campaign, and that he hires people who will help him with that. Neither Trump nor Stewart really care about those dead officers, or all those dead black people.Featured image by LibandJustice. Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via Commons",1
51537, Chris Cuomo STUNNED As Trump’s Advisor Blames Hillary For Melania’s Plagiarized Speech (VIDEO),"Republicans have routinely blamed President Barack Obama whenever something goes wrong, even if it s completely unrelated to him in any way. Perhaps it s a sign that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is going to be replacing Obama in the White House, because the GOP is already blaming the dumbest things on her   including Melania Trump s disastrous speech on the first night of the Republican National Convention.Melania s speech raised eyebrows last night as people immediately recognized how similar it was to First Lady Michelle Obama s speech from the 2008 Democratic National Convention. It was clear that a good chunk of the speech had been plagiarized, but don t expect Trump s campaign to take any responsibility for it. On CNN this morning, Trump campaign advisor Paul Manafort refused to acknowledge the obvious similarities and awkwardly denied any plagiarism. It was an uncomfortable interview with Chris Cuomo, and Manafort made it even worse by trying to blame it on Clinton. Manafort told Cuomo, who appeared stunned by what he was hearing, that Melania s speech was original: There s no cribbing of Michelle Obama s speech. I mean, these were common words and values  I mean, she was speaking in front of 35 million people last night, she knew that. To think that she would be cribbing Michelle Obama s words is crazy. Cuomo pointed out that the speech didn t just pull a few common words   there were word-for-word sentences that were taken from the First Lady s 2008 address. Here s  a few  similarities, as a Twitter user pointed out:TwitterThe truth is blatantly obvious, but Manafort continued to refuse to admit that there had been any sort of wrongdoing and tried to place the blame onto Clinton. He said: This is, once again, an example of what happens when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton. She seeks to demean her and take her down. It s not going to work. You can watch Manafort make a fool of himself below:Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort: Melania Trump s speech used  common words and phrases.  https://t.co/lkuwa1KM6O  CNN (@CNN) July 19, 2016Manafort isn t the only Trump advisor blaming Clinton for this incident. Donald Trump senior advisor Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the Trump campaign and Melania on Fox News  America s Newsroom when host Martha MacCallum pointed out that the speech had been lifted. When MacCallum brought up the fact that many people thought Manafort should be fired for allowing such a thing to happen, Huckabee Sanders said: I think the person who ought to be fired is Hillary Clinton. She broke the law and that s been completely ignored. Featured image is a screenshot",1
