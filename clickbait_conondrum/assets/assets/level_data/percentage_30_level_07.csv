68494,California Today: Questions Persist After the Oakland Fire - The New York Times,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Sign up.) Ten days have passed since a fire ripped through an Oakland warehouse during an electronic music show and killed 36 people. The Times is chasing a number of questions that arose after the fire. The latest of what we know: • The victims: On Wednesday, firefighters ended their search of the   structure that had housed a rambling artists’ colony. The final toll made it the country’s deadliest structure fire since 2003, when 100 people died at a nightclub in West Warwick, R. I. The Oakland victims, many of them artists and musicians who ranged in age from 17 to 61, have been profiled in The Times, The Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle and East Bay Times, among other publications. On Sunday, the first funerals were held for two of the victims  —   Jonathan Bernbaum, 34, and Draven McGill, 17  —   the Chronicle reported. • The cause: Investigators have not figured out how the fire erupted, but no evidence has suggested arson, they say. Scrutiny has centered on a possible electrical source. On Friday, officials ruled out an appliance that had seemed a likely culprit: a faulty refrigerator. Jake Jacobitz, who did electrical work at the warehouse, told East Bay Times that all of the structure’s power came from a single line threaded through a wall. Electrical breakers blew out frequently, he said. The authorities have warned we may never know for certain what caused the Dec. 2 blaze. Reporters from The Times’s graphics department illustrated how the mazelike layout of the warehouse complicated escape from the fire. • The owner: Chor Nar Siu Ng, the warehouse owner since 1988, has not been heard from. Examining city records, The Times’s Julie Turkewitz learned that Ms. Ng owns a number of properties in Oakland and has been fined in the past for “nuisance or substandard or hazardous or injurious” conditions. Several people who have stayed at the Ghost Ship said Ms. Ng had visited the warehouse, which was not permitted for residents. But it was unclear if she knew what was going on inside. • The master tenants: Derick Ion Almena and his wife, Micah Allison, who ran the Ghost Ship, have also avoided the public eye. Friends, associates and former tenants speaking in the news media have variously depicted the couple as misunderstood or manipulative. In an anguished interview on “Today” last week, Mr. Almena was asked whether he should be held accountable. “Should I be held accountable?” he said. “I can barely stand here right now. ” • The aftermath: Artists dwelling in illegal structures across the Bay Area are worried that inspectors would target them after the fire. The crackdown has been nationwide. There have been reports of spaces scrutinized or shut down in Baltimore, Nashville, Philadelphia, Dallas, Austin, Indianapolis, New Haven and Dubuque. Libby Schaaf, the Oakland mayor, said the city was weighing new measures to address fire safety, among them stricter requirements for smoke alarms and emergency exits. A criminal investigation into the fire is continuing. As Times reporters investigate the Ghost Ship fire, we are doing something new: posting regular updates on our findings.

46865, Former US Labor Secretary Has Dire Warning: Trump Is Trying To Start A Civil War,"To one former labor secretary, what Donald Trump is trying to do is clear as day: He s trying to start a civil war.Robert Reich, who served as labor secretary under President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 1997, says Trump s goal all along has been to spark another civil war here in the United States. In an op-ed on his website, Reich explained his stance further.Trump s goal has never been to promote guns or white supremacy or to fuel attacks on the press and the left. These may be means, but the goal has been to build and fortify his power. And keep him in power even if it s found that he colluded with Russia to get power.Trump and his consigliere Steve Bannon have been quietly encouraging a civil war between Trump s base of support   mostly white and worried   and everyone who s not.It s built on economic stresses and racial resentments. It s fueled by paranoia. And it s conveyed by Trump s winks and nods haters, and his deafening silence in the face of their violence.Reich then explained that there is another civil war currently raging within the White House  where Bannon and his prot g s are doing battle with leveler heads. Let s hope the leveler heads win the civil war in the White House. Let s pray the leveler heads in our society prevent the civil war Trump and Bannon want to instigate in America,  he concludes.Reich s article condemned Trump for failing to denounce the white supremacist ideologies that were responsible for the death of Heather Heyer, who was killed in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend when a Nazi plowed his car through a group of counter protesters. Since then, Trump has claimed that  many sides  are to blame, but as Reich explains, this is all just part of his plot to kick off another civil war. The thought is absolutely terrifying.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",1
26014,Russian warships dock in Philippines as Manila cultivates new ties,"MANILA (Reuters) - Three Russian warships, including two anti-submarine vessels, docked in Manila on Friday to unload what navy officials said was weaponry and military vehicles donated to the Philippines as part of a new defense relationship. It was the third port visit this year by Russian warships as part of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte s moves to engage closely with Moscow, an arch-rival of Manila s former colonial master and closest defense ally, the United States. The load included 5,000 assault rifles, a million rounds of ammunition and 20 army trucks, Russian and Filipino navy officials said.   We would do our best to make this port call a significant contribution indicating friendly ties and relations between two nations in the interest of security and stability in this region,  said Eduard Mikhailov, deputy commander of Russia s Pacific Fleet flotilla. The visit was timed to coincide with the arrival next week of Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, who is attending a regional defense meeting, and U.S. counterpart Jim Mattis, a Philippine navy spokesman said. Russia and the Philippines are expected to sign a security deal on military logistics next week. ",0
53038, WATCH: CNN Smacks Down Rudy Giuliani So Hard He Starts Blaming President Obama For Shootings,"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani had his ass handed to him so badly that he resorted to spouting Trump talking points to distract from the whipping he just received.During an appearance on CNN on Tuesday, host Chris Cuomo slammed Giuliani for refusing to say the word  gay  in reference to the Orlando mass shooting that occurred over the weekend, thus following other Republicans like Mitch McConnell and Florida Governor Rick Scott who would rather pretend there is no such thing as gay people.Giuliani claimed not saying the word is okay because President Obama won t say  radical Islamic terrorism.  But Cuomo had the perfect response to that bullshit by asking Giuliani how he would feel if people referred to mob violence as radical Italian terrorism. Calling this gay and not using that word and not running away from it because of some sense of identity politics is wrong and you agree with that,  Cuomo began. Saying  radical Islamic terror    you used an analogy, let me reverse it on you. If every time the mafia made a killing or a murder, they said  well, those Italians, well there s something about  em, and the mob. There s something about the Giuliani and the Cuomo.  How would you have felt? You would have been disgusted. It s one of the things that motivated you as a prosecutor to distinguish the mafia from the rest of the Italians. That is the same point, is it not? That you can t talk about all of Islam you talk about these perversions. Of course, Giuliani claimed that they weren t the same thing but Cuomo quickly countered,  But if you said  radical Italian murders They call themselves the Islamic State,  Giuliani said, which gave Cuomo the opening he needed to smack down the right-wing mayor for making ISIS happy. They do because they want the credit of owning the religion,  Cuomo informed Giuliani.  They want that. Why would you give them what they want? Rather than admit that he s helping ISIS in their crusade to own Islam, Giuliani quickly changed the subject to blaming President Obama for the attacks in Orlando and San Bernardino and repeating Trump s suggestion that President Obama is in league with the terrorists.Cuomo didn t buy the bullshit Giuliani was trying to sell. I think there s some politics being played with this. With Donald Trump coming out and seeming to suggest that President Obama has some sympathy, some compromise personally that doesn t keep him from being tough. With all the troops, with taking out OBL (Osama Bin Laden), I mean, it just doesn t seem like the right kind of rhetoric. I don t think if you were running you would ever suggest anything like that about a Commander in Chief. But Giuliani just continued to blame President Obama and claimed he is weak on terror, conveniently forgetting that the 9/11 attacks occurred on his own watch as NYC mayor in 2001. President Bush was also in charge on that day, yet Giuliani somehow believes that Bush was strong against terrorism despite the fact that 3,000 Americans died that day in attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that are far worse than any terrorist that has occurred before or since.Here s the video via YouTube:In addition, President Obama stated recently that the FBI has been tracking ISIS sympathizers but are unable to keep them from buying guns like Omar Mateen did because Republicans refuse to ban people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms. If Republicans had done that when President Obama asked a long time ago this shooting could have been prevented because the FBI would have been able to make sure that every time Mateen walked into a gun shop, he would be flagged as a possible threat and would have been denied the assault rifle he used in the massacre. Someone should ask Giuliani why his party wants terrorists to have guns so much.Featured Image: Screenshot",1
42207,VIGILANTE PIRATES INTERCEDE Where Government Fails: Prevent Refugees From Reaching Sweden’s Shores,"Like the Soldiers of Oden vigilante group we reported about in February, the National Framed vigilante group is tired of waiting for an inept government to protect its citizens from dangerous criminals arriving by boat from nations who have no intention of assimilating in their country. They ve decided instead, to take matters into their own hands A far right group of vigilante pirate migrant hunters are patrolling Sweden s southern coast by speedboat in a bid to tackle illegal immigration.Nationell Framtid s boats monitor the strait of  resund, a 5km stretch of water between Denmark and Sweden for illegal migrants   who they say are entering Sweden with the help of organised criminal gangs and left wing Danish  do-gooders who think they are helping .Their pseudo-paramilitary get up   all in black punctuated with a bright red tie and insignia badge on their chest paired with black balaclavas and doc martins   are a sinister sight on the misty water.Dennis Ljung, 31, leads the patrol   his far right group the Nationell Framtid   translated as National Future   emerged in April last year during the migrant crisis. We need to take our country back. Our aim is to cleanse our nation free of all immigrants. What we do out on the ocean is just a small step to stop more the mass immigration we have faced for decades,  he told MailOnline.While he is heavily in debt and unemployed, Dennis is one of the few members of the group without a criminal record according to local media reports. At least 11 members have reportedly been convicted for weapons offences and several violent crimes. He dismisses allegations the organisation has neo-Nazi sympathies despite also admitting that  of course  they are in touch with the Soldiers of Odin   a gang of violent white supremacist vigilantes patrolling Finland s streets to  prevent migrant sex attacks . We are a broader organisation than them. We have a written manifesto that outlines our political views, and a code of conduct for how members of Nationell Framtid are supposed to behave   we are not supposed to use violence unless it is necessary for example,  said Dennis. I will never say that we are an organisation of Nazis. Of course we have members who have been involved in that movement, but we are strong nationalists. That is it. Far right vigilante anti-migrant groups across Europe have mushroomed since violence blamed on newcomers rocked the continent.While authorities say they received a record 163,000 applications for asylum in 2015 and are expecting a further 100,000 this year, nearly half may be rejected.Members of Nationell Framtid have been drawn to the group for different reasons, but one thing is clear   they feel the government is not doing enough to prevent illegal immigration to Sweden.Two small speedboats patrol the strait, three men per boat who work 5 or 6 days each week.To help them track down their target  suspicious boats , they re armed with radar, radios, binoculars and  intel  from supporters in Denmark who tip them off to when are where smugglers cross. Once their target is acquired, the team spring into action.Charging through the waters at full speed, shouting warnings through a megaphone the men tell the captain to stop and that they have called the police then shadow them until they leave the Swedish coastline and return to Denmark.If they refuse, the men manoeuvre their small speedboat in front of the boat to stop them from progressing and scream:  We won t leave until you turn around . All boats that we challenge have turned around and gone back to Denmark,  Dennis told MailOnline. In most cases we haven t actually seen any immigrants, we just know that they are inside the boats. At first, their aggressive tactics and menacing attire caused a problem, Dennis admitted to MailOnline during a three-hour interview on their boat in the middle of the strait. As three men in balaclavas and black uniforms we can easily be seen as some kind of modern age pirates. If they have not heard about us they probably see us as dangerous maniacs, but people are used to us and seem to accept what we are doing. Some even praise us since the coast guard is not doing its job,  he said. Via: Daily Mail ",1
53487,BREAKING: WHY DID MASSACHUSETTS OFFICIALS WAIT SO LONG To Release This Video Showing Thug Shooting Police Officer In Face? [VIDEO],"Where was the media coverage when this black thug shot a white police officer in the face? It clearly doesn t fit their narrative which explains why this horrific incident took place on March 27, 2015 and the video is just being released today Massachusetts officials on Friday released video footage showing the near-fatal shooting of a Boston police officer last month by a man who was subsequently shot dead by other officers.The decision to release the footage comes amid protests in several major U.S. cities over a series of killings of civilians in recent months. The latest occurred last Saturday when a white officer in South Carolina was videotaped shooting an unarmed black man as he fled after a traffic stop. It is in everyone s best interest to share (this) information as soon as possible in order to tamp down speculation and rumors meant to inflame and not inform,  Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said at a news conference.The video shows six-year Boston Police Department veteran John Moynihan and two colleagues approaching a car stopped at about 6:40 p.m. on March 27 in Boston s Roxbury neighborhood.As Moynihan stands near the driver s door, a man identified by police as 41-year-old Angelo West jumps out of the vehicle, shoots Moynihan in the face and runs out of the camera frame as Moynihan falls to the ground.Authorities say West, who had a criminal record including prior gun charges, was shooting at police as he ran and that Moynihan s fellow officers returned fire, killing him.Moynihan, 34, is recovering after surgery to remove a bullet lodged in his neck.Local leaders at the news conference said that anger toward police over the incident was minimal. We need to be very aware that the work of police officers is indeed very dangerous,  said Rev. Mark Scott, of the Azusa Christian Community in Boston s Dorchester neighborhood.He called West s death  tragic,  but added that once someone pulls a gun on a police officer,  you don t leave the police any other option but to respond. The Suffolk District Attorney s office is investigating the shootings and has said it will release a full report on the incident later.Via: Reuters",1
1371,"Obama on FBI: 'We don't operate on innuendo,' leaks","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama defended Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Wednesday and criticized the FBI  announcement of new emails linked to her private server, saying there was no room for innuendo in the investigative process. In his first comment since the FBI reported a new cache of emails possibly related to Clinton, Obama said in a radio interview he did not want to meddle in the process.  But his displeasure at how it unfolded was clear. “I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we don’t operate on innuendo and we don’t operate on incomplete information and we don’t operate on leaks. We operate based on concrete decisions that are made,” he told NowThisNews in the interview, which was taped on Tuesday and aired on Wednesday. The FBI said on Friday it had found new emails that might pertain to Clinton’s use of a private server for government business while she was Obama’s first secretary of state from 2009-13. FBI Director James Comey said he did not know whether the emails were significant and released no information other than that they existed. His announcement 11 days before the Nov. 8 election drew outrage from Democrats and others who believed it would unfairly influence the vote. The decision flouted longstanding FBI traditions of keeping investigations confidential and avoiding politically sensitive announcements close to a presidential election.  On Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he would “neither defend nor criticize” Comey’s decision. However, he added that the president expected “an adherence to longstanding tradition and practice and norms that limit public discussion” of information gathered in such investigations. Little is known yet about the emails, which were found during an unrelated probe into former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Obama noted that the FBI already has determined that Clinton had not intentionally transmitted classified information over her private email server but had been “extremely careless.””When this was investigated thoroughly the last time, the conclusion of the FBI the conclusion of the Justice Department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was that she had made some mistakes but that there wasn’t anything there that was prosecutable,” Obama said. Obama defended Clinton, whose increasingly confident campaign was blindsided by the FBI announcement, as someone who has always put the American people first. “When she makes a mistake, an honest mistake, it ends up being blown up as if it’s some crazy thing,” he said. “I trust her, I know her. And I wouldn’t be supporting her if I didn’t have absolute confidence in her integrity and her interest in making sure that young people have a better future.” ",0
52397, Ann Coulter Just Made The Most Despicable Claim About Hispanics In Defense Of Trump (VIDEO),"In response to Trump s outrageous remarks about abortion, Ann Coulter upped the ante by claiming that the border wall will cut the abortion rate by keeping  Latin American rape culture  out of the nation.Two days after calling Trump s idea to punish women for choosing to have an abortion  fabulous,  Coulter appeared for an interview with MSNBC host Chris Matthews and not only doubled down, but entwined abortion, rape, and immigration into one big offensive remark that should cost the Republican Party the votes of Hispanics and women for generations.Coulter attacked Ted Cruz for portraying Trump as a pro-choice supporter of universal healthcare before chiming in on abortion and how it s not an issue the president should get involved with. If Donald Trump was running for state legislature in the year 2060 after Roe v. Wade was overturned and happens to be in a place that will pass those laws, that s a relevant question,  she said.But then Coulter went off the rails completely by claiming that Hispanic immigrants are rapists who are responsible for the number of women who need abortion services. The solution, Coulter insisted, is Trump s proposed wall between Mexico and the United States. I think I d be a lot more upset that women are going to get a lot more abortions if we don t close our border with Mexico and bring in all of Latin American rape culture. Coulter went on to claim that Trump is the guy to vote for if women want a president who will protect them.Here s the video via YouTube.First off, if women want a candidate who has their best interests at heart, Donald Trump is most certainly not the candidate they should support. Trump has already suggested punishing women who seek an abortion, which alone should be enough to prove that he doesn t give a damn about women.Furthermore, Coulter repeated Trump s racist accusation that all Hispanic immigrants are rapists, only she added to it by claiming that they re responsible for women needing abortions.In short, Republicans should be scared to death because their front-runner has just pissed off both Hispanics and women like no candidate has ever done before. Even Ted Cruz has waded into the abortion debate by telling Fox host Megyn Kelly that he wants to force rape victims to carry their rapist s baby to term instead of giving them access to abortion. So Cruz is no better than Trump when it comes down to it.The bottom line is that this is by far the most despicable remark made by Trump or one of his supporters during this election cycle and it should cost the GOP dearly in November.

70795, John Hagee: Vote For Trump Or Face The Wrath Of God (VIDEO),"It s funny how extreme right-wing Christians always think they know what their God is thinking about politics, especially since most of the candidates who say that God told them to run for president never even get the nomination, much less become president. Well, another such right-wing Christian has added his voice to this narrative: Pastor John Hagee. On the Tuesday edition of his show Hagee Hotline, the fiery preacher issued a dire warning: Vote for Donald Trump in November, or God will come for you. Hagee warned that  God will not hold us harmless,  and that voting is an imperative duty. He continued to rant: I m going to vote for the candidate that s going to make the U.S. military great again. I m going to vote for the party that is going to solve the immigration problem, not the one that has created the immigration problem. I m going to support the party that brings jobs back from China   I m not going to vote for the party that has betrayed Israel for the past seven years. If you can read a newspaper, you know who I m talking about. No candidate is perfect, but I want you to go vote and may God give us a leader who has the courage to put America first and stand up for we the people. Now, I don t know about you, but this sounds an awful lot like a preacher putting politics into religion to me. If Hagee s ministry is tax exempt, he needs to lose that status if he can t stop the politicking. Further, no higher power   if one were to actually exist   would want a dangerous, racist, sexist, xenophobic narcissist as the leader of the free world.This election cycle sure has brought out the nutjobs, all thanks to the likes of Donald Trump. If that man wins, we re ALL going to need some divine intervention for sure.Watch the video of Pastor Hagee s comments, via Right Wing Watch:Featured image via video screen capture",1
46670,HARVEY WEINSTEIN RAPE ACCUSER Has Warrant Issued For Her Arrest…Coincidence?,"Was the first actress who outed accused rapist and serial sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein targeted for ratting out the Hollywood kingpin producer or is this simply a case of another Hollywood liberal who believes she s above the law and can t believe she is actually going to be charged with felony drug possession? Aren t felony drug possessions supposed to be for the little people who pay to watch Hollywood actors perform?

This image of liberal activist and actress Rose McGowan was tweeted by the pro-abortion group Emily s List on Twitter:An arrest warrant for felony possession of a controlled substance has been issued for actress Rose McGowan, who is one of dozens of women who accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct.The felony charge stems from a police investigation of personal belongings left behind on a United flight arriving at Washington Dulles International Airport on January 20.Police say the items tested positive for narcotics, but they did not reveal what type of drugs they were. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Police Department obtained the warrant on February 1.Police say they ve attempted to contact McGowan so she can appear in a Loudoun County, Virginia, court.The warrant has been entered into a national law enforcement database.McGowan had not released a statement regarding the warrant as of Monday night.But she simply tweeted  FACT  early Tuesday morning in a retweet suggesting that if she had  taken the million dollars in hush money  from Weinstein, the warrant would not have been issued and not been a news story.McGowan retweeted Ashlee Marie Preston  who wrote:  If @rosemcgowan would have taken that million dollars in hush money I m quite sure this wouldn t even be a headline The 44-year-old actress also tweeted earlier on Monday claiming that there was a warrant for her arrest, but police would not confirm the details at the time.

21650,US to Hold Off on Cyberwar With Russia Until After Election,"Rep. Schiff: US Doesn't Want to Provoke Retaliation Before Vote by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This 
While the Obama Administration has made much of its intention to start a full-scale cyberwar against Russia at a “time of their choosing,” the most recent reports suggest that the war is effectively on hold at least until the presidential election in two weeks. 
From President Obama’s standpoint, the hope is to work with Hillary Clinton, if she becomes president-elect, to launch a cyber war that they both can get behind. Indeed, both have appeared very hawkish against Russia, and Obama apparently doesn’t want to deny Clinton a chance to participate in the early days of a war she’d inherit. 
Starting a cyberwar ahead of a Trump win would be even less wise, as Trump has opposed the idea of picking fights with Russia, and expressed strong doubts about Democratic Party “certainty” that Russia is behind hacks against them. 
Rep. Adam Schiff (D – CA), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says that another factor is concern about provoking Russian retaliation for such a US attack before the vote, with many Democrats concerned Russia could release “forged” documents to embarrass the Clinton campaign. 
Earlier this month, Vice President Joe Biden reported that he has informed Russia of an imminent retaliatory hack, and says the Obama Administration will pick a time which will “have the greatest impact.” Russia has denied any involvement in the hacks. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",1

No, I say it because white people don t have to deal with this kind of total bullshit on a daily basis:In the video uploaded to YouTube, a man identified by The Free Thought Project as 29-year-old Charles Harrell, can be seen on screen with a police officer on a bicycle following closely behind him. You can t be a black man and enjoy your morning, because the police are going to harass you in Cincinnati, Ohio,  Harrell explained.  Walking down the street, the cop just asked me if I have a problem. Off-camera the officer, identified as Baron Osterman, can be heard telling Harrell that he crossed against the light on the deserted street. Sir, you were scaring me, sir. I don t know why were following me, anyway,  Harrell replied.  You were following me all the way down the street. If you watch the video, the cop was following Harrell obviously looking for a reason to stop him. As soon as he crossed against the light, the officer leapt into action to deal with the dastardly crime of drinking coffee while black jaywalking. Harrell is arrested because he had the gall to stand up for his civil right not to be harassed for no reason whatsoever.Here s the video: I m 42 years old and I have literally never been stopped by a cop while walking in my life except that one time I jumped a turnstile in high school. This is why it s awesome to be white in America. The cops don t see you as you go about your life and you don t see them. But if you re black, especially a black male? You have a giant neon sign over your head that says  CAUTION! POTENTIAL CRIMINAL! Most white people don t understand this reality at all. Even white people like me that do understand it only do so on an intellectual level. The closest I can get to understanding it on an emotional level is this:You know that feeling of dread you get when you re driving and a cop car gets in your lane behind you? Your heart rate goes up and you get nervous. Did you forget to signal a turn? Is one of your lights out? Are you speeding? What does he want? What? WHAT?!Now imagine the cop car is always behind you everywhere you drive and if you sneeze the wrong way, those flashing lights are going to turn on instantly. That s what I imagine it must be like to be like to be black in a heavily policed community. Oh, and as a bonus, instead of getting a ticket, there s a good chance you ll get the shit beaten out of you, arrested or shot. Or possibly all three. Also, you ll be called a nigger thug  and smeared by the  liberal  media if there s even a single picture of you holding a beer.Until we stop pretending that black people bring all this trouble on themselves, America s race problem will never go away.Featured image via screencap",1
31247,"Yes, 'Jihad' Means Warfare Against Unbelievers","Go to Article 
Nothing ought to be plainer, and yet nothing is more obscured, than the meaning of the Islamic concept of jihad. Even if its meaning were at all unclear, every day Islamic jihadists do their best to remind us of what it is. The confusion arises, of course, from the fact that jihad and related concepts are the object of a massive misinformation and disinformation campaign, making books such as William Kilpatrick’s The Politically Incorrect Guide to Jihad so vitally necessary. 
Kilpatrick covers that propaganda campaign ably in this lucid and genial book, which not only explains from Islamic texts and teachings why ISIS and Boko Haram (and other jihad terror groups) are not only not un-Islamic, as is frequently claimed, but quintessentially Islamic – for the Qur’an, as Kilpatrick explains, commands jihad, and Muhammad, who is considered in Islamic theology to the perfect man, to be imitated by Muslims whenever, wherever, and however possible, not only commanded jihad warfare but waged it himself. 
Kilpatrick also helpfully takes up common objections to this line of argumentation – notably the question of why, if Islam really teaches warfare against unbelievers and their subjugation under the hegemony of Islamic law, most Muslims are peaceful. “Peaceful Islam,” Kilpatrick points out, “which Western leaders are counting on to win out over the more violent versions touted by the terrorists, is a holdover from the long-dead colonial era.” Indeed so: the formulation of jihad as primarily an interior spiritual struggle was touted by Islamic scholars at the height of the colonial period, so as to allow for accommodation of the colonial occupiers, who weren’t going away in the foreseeable future. Once they did abscond, however, the conditions that called forth such accommodative teachings no longer existed, and Saudi-funded jihad preachers traversed the globe calling Muslims back to jihad, “the forgotten obligation” of warfare against unbelievers. 
The Politically Incorrect Guide to Jihad shows that this transition had nothing to do with poverty among Muslims or discrimination against them, and indeed, that no conciliation or concession on the part of Western non-Muslims will ever blunt the force of the jihad imperative, since it is rooted in Islamic theological principles that are not susceptible to the prevailing political winds. 
The most valuable sections, however, of this useful and engaging book are the second, “Jihad Without Bombs,” and the third, “Defeating Jihad.” For even as violent jihad becomes an increasingly common feature of the Western landscape, more insidious and damaging in the long run may be the stealth jihad that proceeds due to the appeasement policies that Western governments indefatigably pursue, and the politically correct straitjacket on the public discourse that has for well over a decade now hindered, and usually prevented outright, honest discussion in the mainstream media of the nature and magnitude of this threat. Kilpatrick points out that “according to Reporters Without Borders, the U.S. has dropped to forty-sixth place in press freedom.” One of the principal ways in which the press today reveals itself to be a mouthpiece of moneyed elites is in its deliberate attempts to obfuscate the ideological roots of the jihad threat, and its ongoing campaign, every time there is a jihad attack, to inundate us with articles explaining that Islam is really quite wonderful and has nothing to do with this violence, nothing at all. 
But Kilpatrick details how the media and governing elites are not in the least singular in appearing determined to foster complacency and ignorance among the people they should be enlightening and protecting. The churches are in on the act as well: “Christians,” writes Kilpatrick, “have been lulled into complacency by the oft-repeated emphasis on the similarities between their faith and the faith of Muslims” – an emphasis all too many Church leaders, including, of course, Pope Francis, relentlessly hammer home, heedless of the danger in which they are putting their flock by leaving them intellectually, spiritually, and physically defenseless in the face of an advancing and growing threat. 
That’s why the most apposite sentence in this entire book is the second sentence of the chapter headed “Strategies for Victory”: “First we’ve got to get serious.” The West suffers from a collective lack of seriousness that could, in the end, be fatal. The frivolity is at the top, fueled by globalist internationalists who are using the complacency the media, the government and the Church are fostering for their own ends. The Politically Incorrect Guide to Jihad is the perfect book for those who don’t know just how bad things are, and how likely they are to get even worse – as well as for all who wish to chart a way out of this madness. It can be done. William Kilpatrick does it, quite well, in this book.  ",1
51271,Democrats Drag Out Jeff Sessions’ Confirmation Fight - Breitbart,"Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats forced debate on the confirmation of Jeff Sessions for the position of Attorney General into Wednesday with belabored speeches over Sessions’ qualifications and President Donald Trump’s firing of Obama Administration holdover, acting Attorney General Sally Yates, the night before. [As Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley ( ) opened the hearing, he stated that there would be a vote on confirmation of Sessions for the position of Attorney General, but as the lengthy meeting progressed, Democrats forced the meeting on that vote into Wednesday on a technicality.  Grassley noted in his opening comments that proceedings would commence as did those in the confirmation of former Obama Administration Attorney General Loretta Lynch, adding that it was his understanding that each Democrat on the committee, except two, intended to oppose Sessions’ nomination. Grassley referred to the more than 10 hours of questioning that Sessions endured in a prior committee hearing regarding his confirmation. The senator further noted Democrat opposition that began before those Senators even submitted questions to Sessions, insinuating the partisan political nature of their opposition. Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California rebuked Sessions, accusing him of involvement with the President’s executive action to temporarily restrict travel from seven nations identified as exceptional security risks. It was the Department of Homeland Security under the Obama Administration which identified the seven countries in the Terrorist Prevention Act of 2015 and its 2016 extension. Feinstein heavily referenced and quoted an article from the Washington Post in her lambasting of Sessions, accusing him of guiding the Presidents’ policy agenda. Grassley made clear that Sessions was not involved in the drafting of the executive order based on a statement from Sessions on the matter. Feinstein declared “no confidence” that Sessions would “uphold our laws and civil liberties as attorney general. ” She went on to praise Salley Yates in her   function as acting Attorney General before stating, with no ambiguity, that she would vote no on confirmation of Sessions. In the course of Tuesday’s hearing, Grassley remarked how much longer Democrats were speaking than Republicans. Late on Monday, Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates after she instructed members of the Department of Justice not to defend the President’s executive action, an action which instituted a temporary travel restriction on seven   countries. Yates was a holdover from the Obama Administration, operating in the position of acting AG as the Senate considers the confirmation of Sessions. Sen. Patrick Leahy is leading the effort to block confirmation of Sessions as Attorney General, according to NBC News. During Tuesday’s hearing, Leahy launched into a drawn out condemnation of the President’s firing of Yates. Sen. Ted Cruz specifically cited legal guidance relating to Trump’s executive order and its legality. He rebuked Yates for allowing an act of “brazen partisan lawlessness” and policy disagreement to dictate her duties. As Tuesday’s session neared a close, Grassley set aside 22 minutes for Sen. Al Franken to speak at Wednesday’s hearing, while Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( ) was told he would be granted 20 min. The committee was then scheduled to meet at 10:30 a. m. ET on Wednesday morning with a vote to commence between 11 and 12 a. m. Democrats on two other committees moved to obstruct confirmation of President Trump’s nominees with their refusal to even appear at those hearings.

44676,BREAKING REPORT: MITT ROMNEY To Make Huge Announcement About Running For Major Political Office…There’s Only ONE Thing Standing In His Way,"Sources tell UtahPolicy.com that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is preparing to run for Senate in 2018 if Sen. Orrin Hatch decides to retire.Sources close to Romney say the two-time presidential candidate will jump into the 2018 Utah Senate scrum if Hatch opts not to.So far, Hatch has not made up his mind as to whether he ll run for an eighth term in 2018. He has previously said he was planning on running as long as his and his wife s health holds up.Dave Hansen, a longtime political advisor to Hatch, told UtahPolicy.com last month that he didn t expect Hatch to decide on his political future until October. However, sources now tell UtahPolicy.com that Hatch may not make up his mind until December.Hatch s reticence to make a definitive announcement is presenting other candidates from getting in the race, but Romney has the financial resources to mount a campaign no matter when Hatch decides.A UtahPolicy.com poll shows Romney would be in great shape to win a Senate race against Democrat Jenny Wilson. Romney pulls 64% of the vote to Wilson s 26%. The poll shows Stewart would only be ahead of Wilson 34-30, but that s likely due to Stewart being less familiar to Utah voters.Earlier this year Hatch said he would be willing to step aside if an  outstanding person  like Mitt Romney were to run for the seat he currently holds.

58054,Police have thwarted seven attacks since March: London mayor,"BRIGHTON, England (Reuters) - London Mayor Sadiq Khan said police had thwarted seven attacks by militants since March this year, describing the increase in the number as a shift rather than a spike. Speaking at the annual conference of his opposition Labour Party, Khan also said the police needed more spending to help them counter such attacks and that Internet companies must do more to crackdown on extremist content.  Between March this year and now, there have been four attacks but seven have been thwarted,  he told a Guardian Live event. Earlier this month, the head of the city s police force said six militant plots had been foiled over the last several months.     ",0
68034, Trump Cares More About His Businesses In The Middle East Than The American People,"Donald Trump is no stranger to doing business in the Middle East, yet for some unknown reason, he could never quite crack the Qatar market. Sure, he had been dealing in the hotel business with the Saudis for at least two decades and has his name on quite a few golf courses in the UAE, however, no matter how hard he tried, business deals in Qatar always seemed unattainable for him.Now a feud between these three Gulf nations broke out on June 5, when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Arab allies all broke off trade, travel and diplomatic relations with Qatar as punishment for what they said was its support of terrorism. Many scholars, however, believe that the fallout is the result of a struggle for power and autonomy, but it didn t take long for Trump to throw his support behind the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in the dispute; the two countries out of the three where he has business interests. Trump said his reason for backing Saudi Arabia and the UAE is that Qatar is a  funder of terror at a very high level,  but was this his only reason?The Pentagon and the State Department have a different opinion on the issue to the alleged president, with the secretaries of defence and state trying to encourage unity against a common enemy in ISIS by staying completely neutral on the topic of Qatar, but unlike Donald Trump, the Pentagon and the State Department don t have personal assets in the area. That s right, Trump is the first U.S. president in 40 years to maintain private business interests after entering the White House and many critics believe maintaining a business empire will skew the president s ability to make rational diplomatic decisions that truly are for the good of the people. Trump may have signed his business empire over to his sons at a press conference in January, but as the Director of the Office of Government Ethics warned, stepping away from management without giving up ownership does not diminish his financial incentives or conflicts Other countries in the Middle East see what is happening and may think,  We should be opening golf courses  or  We should be buying rooms at the Trump International,  said Brian Egan, a State Department legal adviser under the Obama administration.  Even if there is no nefarious intent on behalf of the president or the Trumps, for a president to be making money from business holdings in sensitive places around the world is likely to have an impact. When the trouble between Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar kicked off, Dana Smith, the American Ambassador to Qatar, retweeted a Treasury Department article praising Qatar for cracking down on extremist financing, which you can read below.This is so important, I'm sharing it again. Great partnership, real progress to counter terrorist financing. #Qatar https://t.co/yjnEg2IJlF  Dana Shell Smith (@AmbDana) October 26, 2016Not long after Smith s tweet, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged Qatar  to be responsive to the concerns of its neighbors,  while also adding,  We call on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to ease the blockade against Qatar. Then there s Trump s response. He was completely in favor of the blockade the second it started, declaring on Twitter that his visit  was already paying off  and he continued to defend it even after Tillerson had called for it to be eased, saying that  The time had come to call on Qatar to end its funding  of terrorism. Remember, this is the man who said of the Saudis back in 2015 that he likes them because they buy apartments from him.  They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much. It s not just the purchasing of apartments that Trump has to thank Saudi Arabia for   In 1995, Donald Trump sold the Plaza Hotel to a partnership consisting of a Saudi prince, the same prince that paid $18 million for Trump s yacht in 1991 and a Singaporean investor. This $325 million deal on the Plaza enabled Trump to escape a default on his loans.So next time you hear Trump weigh in on the Middle East, ask yourself if he is thinking of the safety of the American people or his own back pocket.Featured image via Chris Kleponis-Pool/Getty Images",1
