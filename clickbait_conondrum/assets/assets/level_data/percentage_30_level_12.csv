5340,Lady Gaga Protests Donald Trump Outside of Trump Tower,"Lady Gaga Protests Donald Trump Outside of Trump Tower 11/09/2016 
E! ONLINE 
Lady Gaga took to Trump Tower early Wednesday morning to protest the results of the U.S. election. 
The “Bad Romance” singer, a well-known Hillary Clinton supporter, stood outside Donald Trump ‘s building and held a sign that read “Love trumps hate.” As the hours passed Tuesday night and it became clearer that Trump would win the presidency, Gaga tweeted, “In a room full of hope, we will be heard. Stand up for kindness, equality, and love. Nothing will stop us. Say a prayer America.” 
Gaga campaigned for Clinton earlier this week, attending a rally where she spoke of Clinton’s strengths. “She has a career in politics that spans decades of experience, education, leadership, and wisdom. She’s ready to be president,” she said. “She kept going and she kept fighting for women’s rights. She kept fighting for the care of our children. She kept fighting for those that are in need.”Trump’s victory was declared around 2:30 a.m. ET, and during his speech he praised Clinton’s efforts throughout the election. He said she was owed a “deep debt of gratitude” for all her hard work. “We will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will deal fairly with everyone. We will seek common ground, partnership not conflict,” he added in his speech. “America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our destiny.”",1
41102," GOP Billionaire Meg Whitman Endorses Hillary Clinton, Trashes Trump","Another day, another billionaire and/or Republican refuses to endorse the train wreck that is Donald J. Trump. While a slew of influential Republicans   elected or not   have rescinded or flat out refused to endorse the GOP presidential nominee, others have stubbornly remained by his side even after being stabbed in the back.But as Trump continues to say any outrageous, offensive and grotesque thing that comes to mind, one influential mega donor in the party is saying  enough  and is endorsing Trump s rival, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton instead. And her endorsement of Clinton isn t a  I guess I m with her  mentality, either   it s a full blown  Ready for Hillary  sentiment.Meg Whitman, a self made billionaire who didn t have any help from her daddy, posted a stinging denouncement of Trump on her Facebook. Earlier this year, during the primary, Whitman expressed concern that Trump s rhetoric would hurt the party and turn off the electorate.  It turns out she was right, as Hillary Clinton has taken the lead (for now) by margins of 7 points to 15 points nationally.Whitman referred to Trump as  uninformed,   unsteady,   authoritarian,  and a  demogauge.  She also praised Clinton for being an experienced, level-headed leader:As a proud Republican, casting my vote for President has usually been a simple matter. This year is different. To vote Republican out of party loyalty alone would be to endorse a candidacy that I believe has exploited anger, grievance, xenophobia and racial division. Donald Trump s demagoguery has undermined the fabric of our national character.Trump s reckless and uninformed positions on critical issues   from immigration to our economy to foreign policy   have made it abun dantly clear that he lacks both the policy depth and sound judgment required as President. Trump s unsteady hand would endanger our prosperity and national security. His authoritarian character could threaten much more.Therefore, I have decided to support Hillary Rodham Clinton. It is clear to me that Secretary Clinton s temperament, global experience and commitment to America s bedrock national values make her the far better choice in 2016 for President of the United States. In a tumultuous world, America needs the kind of stable and aspirational leadership Secretary Clinton can provide. I urge all Republicans to reject Donald Trump this November.Whitman, who is seen as a more moderate Republican given her positions of abortion, gay marriage and immigration, did the unthinkable: she put country over party. And for that Republicans are already denouncing her like they did Romney, Kasich, Christie Todd Whitman, and so forth.This also shouldn t come as a huge surprise. Whitman has donated to and aligned herself with California senator Barbara Boxer, considered one of the most liberal members of the Senate.Good for Meg Whitman in denouncing Trump and doing what is right. Hopefully more Republicans will take action.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",1
20654,"OBAMA BLAMES RUSSIA For Hillary’s Loss, But NEW HARVARD STUDY Exposes Who REALLY Interfered In Outcome Of Our Elections","A new report from Harvard Kennedy School s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy analyzes news coverage during the 2016 general election, and concludes that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump received coverage that was overwhelmingly negative in tone and extremely light on policy.This is the final report of a multi-part research series analyzing news coverage of candidates and issues during the 2016 presidential election. The study tracks news coverage from the second week of August 2016 to the day before Election Day.Negative coverage was the order of the day in the general election. Not a week passed where the nominees  coverage reached into positive territory. It peaked at 81 percent negative in mid-October, but there was not a single week where it dropped below 64 percent negative.The press s negative bent is not confined to election politics (see Figure 4).[2] In recent years, when immigration has been the subject of news stories, the ratio of negative stories to positive ones has been 5-to-1. In that same period, news reports featuring Muslims have been 6-to-1 negative. News stories about health care policy, most of which centered on the 2010 Affordable Care Act, have been 2-to-1 negative. Although the nation s economy has steadily improved since the financial crisis of 2008, one would not know that from the tone of news coverage. Since 2010, news stories about the nation s economy have been 2-to-1 negative over positive.The real bias of the press is not that it s liberal. Its bias is a decided preference for the negative. As scholar Michael Robinson noted, the news media seem to have taken some motherly advice and turned it upside down.  If you don t have anything bad to say about someone, don t say anything at all. [3] A New York Times columnist recently asserted that  the internet is distorting our collective grasp on the truth. [4] There s a degree of accuracy in that claim but the problem goes beyond the internet and the talk shows. The mainstream press highlights what s wrong with politics without also telling us what s right.It s a version of politics that rewards a particular brand of politics. When everything and everybody is portrayed as deeply flawed, there s no sense making distinctions on that score, which works to the advantage of those who are more deeply flawed. Civility and sound proposals are no longer the stuff of headlines, which instead give voice to those who are skilled in the art of destruction. The car wreck that was the 2016 election had many drivers. Journalists were not alone in the car, but their fingerprints were all over the wheel.The research is confined to the election coverage in the print editions of five daily papers (the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and USA Today) and the main newscasts of five television networks (ABC World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN s The Situation Room, Fox s Special Report, and NBC Nightly News). In the case of the newspapers, the analysis covers all sections except sports, obituaries, and letters to the editor. Op-eds and editorials are included, but letters from the public are not. For television, the analysis covers the full daily content of each network s major newscast. Network talk shows are not included.Trump s general election news coverage fit the pattern of earlier stages of the campaign in several respects but not all. The major departure was that his general election coverage was overwhelmingly negative in tone. In our earlier reports, we documented the positive coverage Trump received during the nominating stage of the campaign, a pattern largely attributable to the press s tendency to highlight the horserace in the pre-primary and primary periods. As Trump rose from single digits in the polls and then won key primaries, he got favorable press. It was a story of growing momentum, rising poll numbers, ever larger crowds, and electoral success. The fact that the horse race is the most heavily covered aspect of the nominating phase magnified Trump s favorable coverage.Trump s general election coverage was a stark contrast. His coverage was negative from the start, and never came close to entering positive territory (see Figure 8).  During his best weeks, the coverage ran 2-to-1 negative over positive. In his worst weeks, the ratio was more than 10-to-1. If there was a silver lining for Trump, it was that his two best weeks were the ones just preceding the November balloting. Trump s coverage was negative in all the news outlets in our study, even those that typically side with the Republican nominee (see Figure 9). Fox provided Trump his most favorable coverage, but it was still nearly 3-to-1 negative over positive. The Wall Street Journal was his next best outlet, but its coverage ran 4-to-1 negative. The most negative coverage was carried by CBS at 9-to-1, but Trump s coverage was nearly as negative in most other outlets.Compare to Hillary s coverage:To be sure, changes in journalism are not the only reason that campaigns have become more negative. The party polarization that has seeped into American politics during the past three decades has been accompanied by rising levels of partisan attack. But to claim that party polarization explains the media s negative bent is to ignore the fact that the press s negativity is not confined to party politics. There s barely an aspect of public life that is not subject to intense criticism.A healthy dose of negativity is unquestionably a good thing. There s a lot of political puffery, ineptitude, and manipulation that needs to be exposed, and journalists would be shirking their duty if they failed to expose it. Yet an incessant stream of criticism has a corrosive effect. It needlessly erodes trust in political leaders and institutions and undermines confidence in government and policy.Negative news has partisan consequences. Given that journalists bash both sides, it might be thought the impact would be neutral. It s not. For one thing, indiscriminate criticism has the effect of blurring important distinctions. Were the allegations surrounding Clinton of the same order of magnitude as those surrounding Trump? It s a question that journalists made no serious effort to answer during the 2016 campaign. They reported all the ugly stuff they could find, and left it to the voters to decide what to make of it. Large numbers of voters concluded that the candidates  indiscretions were equally disqualifying and made their choice, not on the candidates  fitness for office, but on less tangible criteria in some cases out of a belief that wildly unrealistic promises could actually be kept.For entire story and study: Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy",1
26682, Even White Nationalists Are Turning On Trump; One Nominee Is Giving Them Hope,"The week of Donald Trump s election, white nationalists celebrated.In the bowels of the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, three blocks from the White House, members of the so-called alt-right movement gathered for what they had supposed would be an autopsy to plot their grim future under a Clinton administration. Instead, they celebrated the unexpected march of their white nationalist ideas toward the mainstream, portraying Mr. Trump s win as validation that the tide had turned in their fight to preserve white culture. It s been an awakening,  Richard B. Spencer, who is credited with coining the term alt-right, said at the gathering on Saturday.  This is what a successful movement looks like. Source: NY TimesWhile they still agree with Trump s agenda, or at least what they think Trump s agenda is, they aren t celebrating anymore. They aren t happy with many of Trump s cabinet picks. Right after the election, I think it was euphoria,  says Kevin MacDonald, a retired evolutionary psychology professor at California State, Long Beach and another white nationalist mainstay.  But as we get into it now, there s more trepidation. MacDonald says Trump s appointments also have rattled the movement, especially his propensity for tapping rich Wall Street bankers. These are globalists in general. They love free trade, they love immigration   big red flags for us,  he says.Source: NPRSo odd that a businessman who brags about his international business ventures would hire globalists. Who could have seen that coming? Anyone who paid attention, that s who, but cheer up our neo-nazi brethren, there s hope for you still (just not for the rest of us). Trump still has his (bad pun ahead) Trump card: Jeff Sessions, who s been tapped for Attorney General. They also like Rex Tillerson, Trump s pick for Secretary of State.MacDonald hopes Sessions, Trump s nominee for attorney general, will clamp down on immigration. White nationalists also like the nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who s seen as being close to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, a darling of the alt-right.While Trump s cabinet might be a little too globalist for these mouth breathers, there s still plenty for them to love. There s little chance under this Republican government that anyone other than white men will make any sort of advances.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",1

42560,How Trump’s Education Nominee Bent Detroit to Her Will on Charter Schools - The New York Times,"Few disagreed that schools in Detroit were a mess: a chaotic mix of charters and traditional public schools, the   in the nation. So city leaders across the political spectrum agreed on a fix, with legislation to provide oversight and set standards on how to open schools and close bad ones. But the bill died without even getting a final vote. And the person most influential in killing it is now   Donald J. Trump’s nominee to oversee the nation’s public schools, Betsy DeVos. Her resistance to the legislation last spring is a window into Ms. DeVos’s philosophy and what she might bring to the fierce and often partisan debate about public education across the country, and in particular, the roles of choice and charter schools. The bill’s proposals are common in many states and accepted by many supporters of school choice, like a provision to stop failing charter operators from creating new schools. But Ms. DeVos argued that this kind of oversight would create too much bureaucracy and limit choice. A believer in a freer market than even some free market economists would endorse, Ms. DeVos pushed back on any regulation as too much regulation. Charter schools should be allowed to operate as they wish parents would judge with their feet. Detroit Public Schools, she argued, should simply be shut down and the system turned over to charters, or the tax dollars given to parents in the form of vouchers to attend private schools. “She is committed to an ideological stance that is solely about the free market, at the expense of practicality and the basic needs of students in the most destabilized environment in the country,” said Tonya Allen, the president of the Skillman Foundation, a nonprofit that works with Detroit children, and a   of the coalition that produced the report that became the basis for the legislation last spring. “If she was showing herself present in places and learning from the practitioners, that’s a fine combination,” Ms. Allen said. “But Betsy never showed up in Detroit. She was very eager to impose experimentation on students that she has not spent time with and children that she does not have consequence for. ” Ms. DeVos has a long career as an education philanthropist and lobbyist, but not as an educator. She and her husband, Dick, an heir to the Amway fortune, are considered the most powerful Republicans in Michigan. In the debate over Detroit schools, Republican lawmakers say, Ms. DeVos withheld her financial support until they agreed to kill the bill. And they were rewarded well when they did: Ms. DeVos’s family began a flood of donations to Republicans that totaled $1. 45 million in seven weeks. Ms. DeVos declined to be interviewed. But her allies say her views have been misinterpreted. “She’s never said choice and choice alone is the panacea for public education,” said Gary Naeyaert, the lobbyist who leads the Great Lakes Education Project, which Ms. DeVos founded to advance charter schools in Michigan in 2001 after her family had spent nearly $5. 8 million on a losing initiative to establish statewide school vouchers. “It’s choice, quality and accountability. ” Hers was a different version of choice, quality and accountability, however, than that envisioned by those who drafted and supported the legislation: a broad coalition of charter school and teachers’ union leaders, the Detroit chamber of commerce and some of the city’s most prominent Republican philanthropists and politicians, its Democratic mayor and the state’s Republican governor. “The misinformation campaign was horrendous,” said Thomas Stallworth III, a former state legislator who lobbied on behalf of the coalition. And the sway of her contributions was too much to overcome. “There’s no way we could compete with that. We don’t have those kinds of resources. ” Ms. DeVos and her husband had lobbied hard for the state law that established charter schools in 1994. It allowed an unusually large number of organizations to start charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately run. But it created little oversight. Even charter school supporters now criticize Detroit as one of the most unregulated markets in the country. About 80 percent of the state’s charters are operated for profit, far higher than anywhere else. In 2011, the DeVoses and the Great Lakes project lobbied successfully to lift a cap on the number of charter schools, fighting off a provision that would have kept failing schools from expanding. In Detroit, which now has a greater proportion of charters than any city but New Orleans, one result was a glut of schools as more charters opened but the city’s population continued to decline. Yet while there are too many seats in schools downtown, there are not enough in the poorest, most remote neighborhoods, where most students live. Traditional and charter schools alike compete with televisions, laptops and bicycles for students  —   and the taxpayer dollars that follow them. More than 150 schools have opened or closed in the last seven years, and it is not unusual to find students who change schools every year, and teachers who do so more often than that. With more than a dozen organizations issuing charters, it is hard for parents to get the information they need to inform their choices. And, in a city of 140 square miles, the   schools usually remain out of reach to the poorest students, because most schools do not offer transportation, and the city bus service is unreliable. Most charters have failed to improve on the dismal performance of the traditional public schools.   national charter networks have stayed away because of the instability of the market. The Walton Family Foundation, which has committed $1 billion over the next five years to expanding charters and choice, similarly withdrew its money from Detroit earlier this year. The legislation proposed earlier this year by Goeff Hansen, a Republican state senator, would have paid off the debt of the city’s traditional public schools, which were on the brink of bankruptcy, and returned control of those schools from the state to a locally elected school board. But the provision that proved most controversial to the DeVoses would have established a Detroit Education Commission, appointed by the mayor. With three members from charter schools, three from the traditional public schools and one an expert in educational accountability, the commission was to come up with an    grading system for all schools, and evaluate which neighborhoods in the city most needed schools. School operators that earned below an A or B could not expand without the commission’s signing off on their location. Schools that earned an F three years in a row could be closed. Ms. DeVos and her husband wrote legislators urging them to reject any legislation that included the commission. Why, they argued, should residents have choice in where they shop for food and travel, but not in schools? She wrote a Detroit News    arguing to “retire” Detroit Public Schools and “liberate all students” to use tax dollars to attend public or charter schools of their choice. Leaders of 20 charter schools in Detroit, including some of the   made a   effort to urge the Legislature to adopt the commission. “We have to be looking at every possible way to expand the choices and the opportunities in the neighborhoods for families,” Clark Durant, a onetime Republican candidate for the United States Senate and the   of a network of schools, said at a news conference alongside Mayor Mike Duggan. “And I believe this is the beginning of that effort. ” The legislation passed the State Senate. But in the House of Representatives, support fell away, as leaders of the Republican caucus reminded the members of how much financial support the DeVoses could withhold. They warned that the DeVoses would finance primary challenges against Republicans who defied her, as they had done to one who voted against the bill to lift the cap on charter schools five years earlier. The DeVoses, said Representative Dave Pagel, a Republican who supported the commission, “made arguments that were strongly heard, and they prevailed. ” Another Republican, declining to comment for fear of alienating Ms. DeVos when she is poised to become a cabinet secretary, sent a link to an article detailing the DeVoses’ financial contributions to Republicans after the vote, saying it explained all there was to explain. The House passed a bill that never included the language establishing the commission. The bill paid off the debt of Detroit Public Schools and returned the city’s traditional public schools to local control. And it will allow the state to close the schools at the bottom of existing state rankings, which Mr. Naeyaert said was proof that Ms. DeVos supported measures to ensure quality. But that will mean shutting down mostly traditional public schools, which in Detroit serve the neediest students, and further desert students in neighborhoods where charters have largely declined to go. “My complaint around this is not that you disagree,” said Ms. Allen, at the Skillman Foundation, “but that you never could come up with another solution to deal with the practical issues of poor public policy that is not only eroding a traditional school system, but eroding all schools. ”",0

5947,Venezuelan Court Revises Ruling That Nullified Legislature - The New York Times,"IQUITOS, Peru  —   Venezuela’s Supreme Court on Saturday reversed parts of a decision to strip the national legislature of its powers, an abrupt shift that came amid mounting domestic and international criticism that the country was edging toward dictatorship. “The decisions of the court have not divested the Parliament of its powers,” Maikel Moreno, the court’s chief judge, said in an address on Saturday afternoon. He said the Supreme Court should not be in conflict with other branches of government “because it is only an arbiter. ” The state television network VTV on Saturday published summaries of the court’s most recent rulings in which the judges said they had “suppressed” parts of an earlier decision to nullify the legislature and allow the court to write laws itself. Judge Moreno said the court had also reversed a decision to strip lawmakers of their immunity from prosecution. The court’s initial ruling, published on Wednesday night, prompted widespread outrage because it removed what most consider to be the last remaining check to President Nicolás Maduro’s growing power, the   legislature. The court, packed with judges loyal to Mr. Maduro, is considered to be controlled by the president. Saturday’s decision appeared to have support among top officials in Mr. Maduro’s government. Ernesto Villegas, the information minister, characterized the previous rulings as a mistake when he took to Twitter on Saturday to say that the court was “correcting the rulings. ” But as of late Saturday, the court itself had not published its rulings on its website, leaving it unclear how far the court planned to go in restoring the legislature’s powers, which it has been chipping away at for more than a year. Margarita López Maya, a Venezuelan political scientist, said the court appeared to consider the legislature to be in contempt, meaning that it might not be able to pass laws, even if the court agreed not to take over its legislative powers. The court has also spent the past year overturning major decisions made by the chamber, Ms. López said, including a law granting amnesty to political prisoners and moves to block the president from expanding his power over the economy. That stalemate, she added, seemed unlikely to change. “It’s like a chess game where you just moved one pawn,” she said. Enrique Sánchez Falcón, a Venezuelan constitutional expert, said he also believed that the court would continue to consider the legislature to be in contempt of the law and questioned whether it was even legal for its earlier decision to be revised. But the series of events had done damage to the rule of law in Venezuela, he said. “The constitutional order of Venezuela has been completely fractured,” he said. On Saturday, the Venezuelan opposition showed no signs that it would accept the court’s reversal as evidence that a respect for democratic principles had been restored. Several thousand protesters gathered in the streets in a show of support for the National Assembly. Witnesses said that security forces dispersed by firing tear gas canisters, which injured at least two lawmakers who had joined the protest. The court’s initial decision also revealed dissent within Mr. Maduro’s movement that could reflect limits on his march toward   rule. Chief among them was Luisa Ortega, the attorney general, who on Friday issued a dramatic rebuke to the president, holding a news conference in which she said that the rulings violated the inclusive spirit of Venezuela’s laws. The decision by the court represented “a rupture in the constitutional order,” Ms. Ortega said. Ms. Ortega, a longtime follower of Mr. Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, has remained loyal to Mr. Maduro. But she emerged as a leading critic when she spoke out against a massacre of civilians by the military in the Barlovento region, outside Caracas, in October. Américo Martí, a Venezuelan lawyer and leftist leader, said that Ms. Ortega’s dissent represented a “kind of democratic reaction within Chavismo and a reflection of the international and national pressure” the movement was facing. The court’s decision generated condemnation outside Venezuela as well, with critics saying that the country had become a dictatorship in all but name. Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, a regional body that aims to promote democracy, trade, and economic and social development, called the move a “  coup,” while the United States and other countries condemned the decision as eroding the country’s democracy. “What we have warned of has finally come to pass,” said Mr. Almagro, who has spent much of the past year chastising the government, even accusing Mr. Maduro of aiming to become a “petty dictator. ” Critics say the court’s assault on the legislature is part of a longer slide away from democracy that has come as the government’s popularity has declined amid the worst economic crisis in recent memory. Falling oil prices and years of economic mismanagement have left many Venezuelans facing shortages of food and basic medicines, setting off widespread protests. The government is holding at least 114 political prisoners, according to Penal Forum, a human rights group. Local elections that were to have been held last year have been postponed.",0
17024,BARACK OBAMA GOES THERE…Compares President Trump To Hitler In Front Of Chicago Audience,"Crains Chicago Business   American democracy is fragile, and unless care is taken it could follow the path of Nazi Germany in the 1930s.Mixed in with many softer comments, that was the somewhat jaw-dropping bottom line of Barack Obama last night as, in a Q&A session before the Economic Club of Chicago, the Chicagoan who used to be president dropped a bit of red meat to a hometown crowd that likely is a lot closer to him than the man whose name never was mentioned: President Donald Trump.Obama s comments came after a series of playful questions from moderator and Ariel Investments President Mellody Hobson in the great Batman vs. Superman debate, for instance, we learned Obama sides with Batman before she eventually asked him what he s learned as a world citizen of sorts.One thing he s learned is that  things don t happen internationally if we don t put our shoulder to the wheel,  Obama said, speaking of the U.S.  No other country has the experience and bandwith and ideals. . . .If the U.S. doesn t do it, it s not going to happen. Obama gave one specific example, but it was a solid one: Ebola. To fight the virus the U.S. did everything from build an airport tarmac in Africa to send in medical teams and ferry medicos from other countries.  We probably saved a million lives by doing that,  he said.At least indirectly, those comments could be seen as criticism of Trump, whose foreign policy focuses on an  America first  paradigm that critics say distracts from this country s unique role.Obama moved from that to talking about a nativist mistrust and unease that has swept around the world. He argued that such things as the speed of technical change and the uneven impact of globalization have come too quickly to be absorbed in many cultures, bringing strange new things and people to areas in which  people didn t (used to) challenge your assumptions.  As a result,  nothing feels solid,  he said.  Sadly, there s something in us that looks for simple answers when we re agitated. Still, the U.S. has survived tough times before and will again, he noted, particularly mentioning the days of communist fighter Joseph McCarthy and former President Richard Nixon. But one reason the country survived is because it had a free press to ask questions, Obama added. Though he has problems with the media just like Trump has had,  what I understood was the principle that the free press was vital. The danger is  grow(ing) complacent,  Obama said.  We have to tend to this garden of democracy or else things could fall apart quickly. That s what happened in Germany in the 1930s which, despite the democracy of the Weimar Republic and centuries of high-level cultural and scientific achievements, Adolph Hitler rose to dominate, Obama noted.  Sixty million people died. . . .So, you ve got to pay attention. And vote. ",1
11074," They Asked Hillary If Trump Is Qualified To Be President, Her Answer Was Epic (VIDEO)","In a CNN interview on Thursday, anchor Chris Cuomo asked Hillary Clinton if presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is qualified to be President of the United States. Her answer was simple and to the point:  No, I do not. Question: ""Do you think Donald Trump is qualified to be president?""""No, I do not.""  Hillaryhttps://t.co/04viDc5G7t  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 19, 2016Clinton then elaborated on her direct answer, and laid out the case she will probably continue to make between now and Election Day.She called the crash of an EgyptAir flight early Thursday an act of terrorism and went on to portray Mr. Trump as dangerously out of step with what a commander in chief would need to do to combat such attacks.She cited his proposal to temporarily bar Muslims from entering American borders, his comments about diminishing the United States  involvement in NATO and his remarks that he would negotiate directly with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, as evidence of how  unmoored  Mr. Trump is on foreign policy.The Clinton campaign has been hammering at Trump s radical ideas and temperament to make the case to voters that he is far too unstable to be given access to America s military and nuclear arsenal. At the same time, members of the intelligence community have already expressed concerns that Trump will even be allowed to receive classified briefings as the party nominees are traditionally given.That message will also likely be amplified in the multi-million dollar advertising and voter mobilization campaign that began this week from the super PAC Priorities USA.The attacks on Trump actually echo some of the attacks made by Democrats in 1964 against Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, who is consider the godfather of modern right-wing conservatism. President Lyndon Johnson s ad,  Daisy, speculated that nuclear Armageddon could come if Goldwater was elected president.The ad was so effective, it only ran once. That fall, Johnson defeated Goldwater in an epic landslide, 61% to 38%.Featured image via Twitter",1
6902,State G.O.P. Leaders Move Swiftly as Party Bickers in Congress - The New York Times,"When Republicans in Kentucky seized total control of the state government last year, Damon Thayer, the majority leader in the State Senate, began asking around for advice from counterparts in other capitals where the party already dominated both the legislative and executive branches. How should we handle all this power? he wanted to know. One answer impressed him, Mr. Thayer said, from a senior Republican lawmaker in Wisconsin: “Move quickly. ” Kentucky Republicans have done just that, swiftly passing laws to roll back the powers of labor unions and restrict access to abortion. But they are only getting started, Mr. Thayer said in an interview: They also plan to make sweeping changes to the education and public pension systems this year. And they have plenty of company. While Republicans in Washington appear flummoxed by the complexities of   rule, struggling with issues from repealing the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, to paying for President Trump’s promised wall on the Mexican border, rising party leaders in the states seem far more at ease and assertive. Republicans have    control in 25 states now, holding both the governorship and the entire legislature, and Republican lawmakers are acting with lightning speed to enact longstanding conservative priorities. In states from New England to the Midwest and across the South, conservative lawmakers have introduced or enacted legislation to erode union powers and abortion rights, loosen gun regulations, expand   programs and slash taxes and spending. State Senator Scott L. Fitzgerald of Wisconsin, the Republican majority leader, said conservatives in the states had taken the party’s national victories in November as a directive to “shake up” government. “That has been amped up as a result of Donald Trump being elected president,” he said. “There’s a higher expectation now. ” If Republicans in the states have taken Mr. Trump as an inspiration, in some respects they are also largely unburdened by his personality and his political whims. Republicans in Congress are plainly struggling to overcome deep internal disagreements and to balance traditional conservative goals with Mr. Trump’s distinctive priorities. But for Republicans in state capitals, these are comparatively remote considerations. Some Democrats fear that while their own party is consumed nationally with fighting Mr. Trump, leaders and activists may be too distracted to throw up effective roadblocks to the ideological agenda that Republicans are ramming through at the state level. “Progressives cannot afford to forget about what’s happening in our backyards,” said Nick Rathod, executive director of State Innovation Exchange, a   liberal group focused on state legislatures. “Some of it is even more egregious than what is currently happening in Washington, D. C. ” Republicans have gained power rapidly in the states since the 2008 presidential election, winning 33 governorships and in many instances entrenching themselves in power through legislative redistricting. Riding to office on a wave of discontent with the Obama administration, headstrong governors in states like Wisconsin and Ohio embarked on a ferocious quest to transform their states, repeatedly battling powerful unions and popular backlash. Sidelining Democratic lawmakers and grinding down liberal interest groups, these Republicans may have helped pave the way for Mr. Trump’s victories in a string of traditionally blue Midwestern states last year. Acting fastest at the moment, though, are four states where Republicans won total control of the government only in November. In addition to Kentucky, Missouri and New Hampshire became   states with the election of Republican governors, and Republicans in Iowa snatched away the State Senate, where Democrats had held their last grip on power. In all four states, Republicans are racing to strip back the influence of labor unions, a key Democratic constituency. In Missouri, where union membership has waned, Gov. Eric Greitens, a telegenic former member of the Navy SEALs, signed a “right to work” bill into law on Monday, denying unions the power to require that workers at companies they represent pay dues or their equivalent as a condition of employment. In Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin signed a similar measure in January, along with the repeal of a law that kept wages high on public construction projects. And in New Hampshire, State Senator Jeb Bradley, the Republican majority leader, said      legislation was a top priority. In Iowa, Republican leaders announced this past week that they would pursue sweeping changes to the collective bargaining rights of public employees. State Senator Bill Dix, the new Republican majority leader, said his party had campaigned on such changes  —   which would cut deeply into unions’ negotiating power  —   and intended to make good on its commitments. He said Republicans would also seek to change state laws governing health care and to enshrine in the State Constitution the right to bear arms. “Iowans expect us to take action,” Mr. Dix said. His counterpart in New Hampshire, Mr. Bradley, a former member of Congress, echoed that language, but cautioned in an interview that Republicans had to move deliberately and not just fast. “We can’t just start bonfires that we can’t put out,” he warned. “But we can certainly move forward with a conservative agenda that’s a reasonable conservative agenda. ” Democrats and labor unions, which in the past have been able to thwart conservative legislation with the help of a supportive governor or a bloc of allies in the legislature, describe the onslaught in newly Republican states as overwhelming. “They’re killing us here in the state of Missouri,” said John Stiffler, executive   of the St. Louis Building  Construction Trades Council. Some unions in the state, shut out of power, are attempting to put the      law up for a direct vote in a 2018 referendum. For the moment, Mr. Stiffler said, union leaders are seeking to meet with Mr. Greitens in the hope of finding a compromise on other policies, like   legislation. “We’re trying to find a way to get even a small audience with him,” Mr. Stiffler said of Mr. Greitens. The Republican agenda in the states goes well beyond limiting unions. Party leaders in Kentucky, New Hampshire and Missouri have signaled that they plan to expand   and charter school programs and, in some instances, to pursue tort reform and to place new regulations on voting. Beleaguered Democrats see each policy as devised to undercut one of their core political constituencies: teachers, trial lawyers, minority voters or young people. In several states that the party has controlled for a longer span, Republican governors have also announced aggressive plans to overhaul the size and functions of government, including a Wisconsin   proposal, backed by Gov. Scott Walker, and a large program of tax cuts in Florida, championed by Gov. Rick Scott. Both men were first elected in 2010. Republicans in a number of states are also pushing a deeply conservative social agenda. In New Hampshire, Mr. Bradley had long been pushing a bill to let people carry concealed guns without a permit repeatedly, it passed both legislative houses only to be vetoed by Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat. “We had no chance of overriding her veto,” lamented the   Mr. Bradley, but Ms. Hassan was elected to the Senate in November. The gun bill cleared the legislature again on Thursday, and the new Republican governor, Chris Sununu, has “every intention of signing it,” David Abrams, a spokesman of his, said. In Kentucky last month, Mr. Bevin, 50, an activist with close ties to the Tea Party, signed a set of new restrictions on abortion, banning the procedure after 20 weeks and requiring that every woman who seeks an abortion undergo an ultrasound first. Iowa Republicans have advanced a bill to defund Planned Parenthood Missouri legislators have filed a barrage of   bills, including one that would ban the procedure entirely, in defiance of the Supreme Court. In a handful of states including Missouri and Texas, lawmakers are considering legislation that would designate public restrooms and locker rooms as  . And as Mr. Trump attempts to crack down on “sanctuary cities” at the national level, lawmakers in states like Texas and Tennessee have proposed measures to force municipalities to enforce federal immigration law more assertively. Democrats and their allies, including groups like Planned Parenthood, often have little recourse in these states but to rally popular outcry and organize for the next election, or to challenge   policies in court. They have succeeded from time to time, including in North Carolina last year, ousting a Republican governor, Pat McCrory, who signed legislation gutting   protections for gay and transgender people. In 2013, Virginia voters broke a Republican monopoly by electing a Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, who campaigned in part against abortion restrictions passed by a   legislature. And in   Louisiana, voters elected a Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, in 2015, to succeed the unpopular Bobby Jindal, who pursued a   agenda and briefly ran for president. Mr. McAuliffe, one of a growing number of Democrats who have called on the national party to devote more attention to state elections, said Democrats should recognize the role governors play in heading off the kind of conservative legislation they find deeply offensive. Mr. McAuliffe, who has used his veto pen 71 times, said Virginia Republicans had pushed “nuttier, more socially divisive legislation than even North Carolina. ” “This isn’t scare tactics  —   this is actually happening,” Mr. McAuliffe said. “If you had a Republican governor, he would have had to sign them, and think where we would be today. ” In Iowa, a Democratic state senator, Janet Petersen, said the zeal of the new Republican majority had broken a mood of passivity among    Democrats. On the Planned Parenthood issue alone, Ms. Petersen said her office had received about 1, 500 emails from alarmed constituents. “If there’s one positive thing to come out of this horrible legislation,” she said, “it’s that complacency is gone. ”",0

Trump s assault on truth and logic, far from hurting him, made him stronger. His appeal part hope, part snarl dissolved party lines and dispatched the two reigning dynasties of U.S. politics. Yet his victory mirrors the ascent of nationalists across the world, from Britain to the Philippines, and taps forces far more powerful than one man s message.We can scarcely grasp what our generation has wrought by putting a supercomputer into all of our hands, all of the time. If you are reading this, whether on a page or a screen, there is a very good chance that you are caught up in a revolution that may have started with enticing gadgets but has now reshaped everything about how we live, love, work, play, shop, share how our very hearts and minds encounter the world around us. Why would we have imagined that our national conversation would simply go on as before, same people, same promises, same patterns? Perhaps the President-elect will stop tweeting but only because he will have found some other means to tell the story he wants to tell directly to the audience that wants to hear it.Time is correct that Trump has perhaps had the greatest impact on the news, but one must wonder why they would choose to reward the bigotry and hate he encouraged and continues to encourage in their annual marketing gimmick. Normally, this would be a run-of-the-mill honor, even for a dictator (Time called Hitler the  greatest threatening force that the democratic, freedom-loving world faces today  in their 1938 article), but Trump thrives off of the attention and Time should have made the decision not to enable him.Featured image via Time",1

21564,Soros-Linked Voting Machines Cause Concern over Rigged Election,"Editor’s Note : If we weren’t already, as soon as our votes went virtual, we became disenfranchised. These machines are hacked every election.
With as corrupt as our system is at this point, it’d be shocking if that weren’t the case.

by Joseph Jankowski
A U.K. based company that has provided voting machines for 16 states, including important battleground states like Florida and Arizona, has direct ties with billionaire leftist and Clinton crusader George Soros. 
With recent WikiLeaks emails showing that Hillary Clinton received foreign policy directives and coordinated on domestic policy with Soros , along with receiving tens of millions of dollars in presidential campaign support from the billionaire, concerns are growing that these shadowy players may pull the strings behind the curtains of the upcoming presidential election.
As Lifezette reports , the fact that the man in control of voting machines in 16 states is tied directly to the man who has given millions of dollars to the Clinton campaign and various progressive and globalist causes will surely leave a bad taste in the mouth of many a voter.
The balloting equipment tied to Soros is coming from the U.K. based Smartmatic company, whose chairman Mark Malloch-Brown is a former UN official and sits on the board of Soros’ Open Society Foundation.
According to Lifezette , Malloch-Brown was part of the Soros Advisory Committee on Bosnia and also is a member of the executive committee of the International Crisis Group, an organization he co-founded in the 1990s and built with funds from George Soros’ personal fortune.
In 2007 Soros appointed Malloch-Brown vice-president of his Quantum Funds, vice-chairman of Soros Fund Management, and vice-chairman of the Open Society Institute (former name of OSF).
Browns ties also intertwine with the Clintons as he was a partner with Sawyer-Miller, the consulting firm where close Clinton associate Mandy Grunwald worked. Brown also was also a senior advisor to FTI Consulting, a firm at which Jackson Dunn, who spent 15 years working as an aide to the Clintons, is a senior managing director. When taking that into account, along with the poor track record Smartmatic has of providing free and fair elections, this all becomes quite terrifying.
An astonishing 2006 classified U.S. diplomatic cable obtained and released by WikiLeaks reveals the extent to which Smartmatic may have played a hand in rigging the 2004 Venezuelan recall election under a section titled “A Shadow of Fraud.” The memo stated that “Smartmatic Corporation is a riddle both in ownership and operation, complicated by the fact that its machines have overseen several landslide (and contested) victories by President Hugo Chavez and his supporters.”
“The Smartmatic machines used in Venezuela are widely suspected of, though never proven conclusively to be, susceptible to fraud,” the memo continued. “The Venezuelan opposition is convinced that the Smartmatic machines robbed them of victory in the August 2004 referendum. Since then, there have been at least eight statistical analyses performed on the referendum results.”
“One study obtained the data log from the CANTV network and supposedly proved that the Smartmatic machines were bi-directional and in fact showed irregularities in how they reported their results to the CNE central server during the referendum,” it read.
With such suspicion and a study which claims to prove that the U.K. firm’s equipment tampered with the 2004 Venezuelan recall election, should be enough for states to reject these machines if they desire a fair election.
Smartmatic is providing machines to Arizona, California, Colorado, Washington DC, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin, which means these Soros and Clinton linked machines are going to take the votes of thousands of Americans.
While GOP nominee Donald Trump has been voicing his opinion that the elections are indeed rigged due to media bias, and the proof that mainstream polls are heavily weighted to favor Clinton , it is needless to say that if the results show Hillary as a winner in November, there is going to be a mess to shuffle through to find signs of honesty.

24393,What We Know About the Details of the Police Shooting in Charlotte - The New York Times,"CHARLOTTE, N. C.  —   The fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott here on Tuesday afternoon has sparked outrage and concern, and set off, once again, a national conversation about the treatment of minorities by the police. The details of the case have also been a source of intense debate. Here are some questions that readers have asked reporters at The New York Times since Mr. Scott’s death. Why did police officers confront Mr. Scott? Two officers with the   Police Department determined that Mr. Scott, 43, was a potential threat to public safety because they saw him with two items: what they believed was a marijuana cigarette and a gun, according to a statement released on Saturday by the department. The plainclothes officers, who had been near Mr. Scott’s home to serve a warrant on another person, first noticed Mr. Scott when he parked his S. U. V. next to their unmarked police vehicle, which was in his apartment complex in Charlotte’s University City neighborhood. The department said in a statement that its officers initially saw Mr. Scott “rolling what they believed to be a marijuana ‘blunt,’” but ignored the behavior and went about their business. Later, one of the officers, Brentley Vinson, 26, said he saw Mr. Scott “hold a gun up,” the statement said. (A separate statement issued by the city on Tuesday said that Mr. Scott “exited the vehicle armed with a firearm,” and that officers approached him after he got back inside his white S. U. V.) After seeing the gun, the authorities said on Saturday, the officers decided to approach Mr. Scott, but they first left the area to don safety vests that identified them as the police. They returned to the vicinity of his S. U. V. and “again” saw Mr. Scott with a gun. What do the police say about why Officer Vinson fired upon Mr. Scott? Body and dashboard camera footage released on Saturday provided no clear evidence that Mr. Scott had a gun. In the video, Mr. Scott’s arms were at his sides and he was backing away from his vehicle when he was shot. In its statement on Saturday, the department said the officers gave “clear, loud and repeated verbal commands” to Mr. Scott that he should drop his handgun. When Mr. Scott did not, the department said, Officer Vinson “perceived Mr. Scott’s actions and movements as an imminent physical threat to himself and the other officers” and opened fire. The State Bureau of Investigation is leading an inquiry into the shooting. Although the Charlotte police chief, Kerr Putney, said on Saturday that Officer Vinson was “absolutely not being charged by me at this point,” the decision about whether the officer will face prosecution will ultimately fall to others. “If there was a weapon in his hand, then the case for using lethal force becomes stronger,” said Kami Chavis, a law professor who is the director of the criminal justice program at Wake Forest University in   N. C. But she also noted that there have been cases in which a person was unarmed “but it was determined that a reasonable officer could have viewed whatever it was in their hands as a weapon. ” In many of those cases, officers were cleared of criminal conduct. “Even if the officer was mistaken about what he had in his hand, and yet it was reasonable, it could be deemed a justified shooting,” Professor Chavis said. Some critics argue that the police overreacted. “It seems there were multiple opportunities to do this in a   way, and it seems like everything they did in response was escalating,” said Mark Dorosin, the managing lawyer at the University of North Carolina Center for Civil Rights. “I think there’s an argument to be made that they exceeded their authority. ” What evidence do the police say shows that Mr. Scott had a gun? Chief Putney has flatly and repeatedly said that Mr. Scott had a gun, but he also acknowledged that no recording exists to definitively prove the department’s account. The police statement on Saturday said that crime scene investigators recovered a loaded gun at the scene and that a forensic analysis revealed Mr. Scott’s DNA and fingerprints on the weapon. The police also released a photograph of the gun, as well as one of an ankle holster they said Mr. Scott was wearing. The police have not said where they recovered the weapon, but the photograph of the gun shows it resting on asphalt, next to an evidence marker. In the short video that Scott family lawyers made public on Friday, Mr. Scott’s wife, Rakeyia, can be heard telling the officers: “Don’t shoot him. He has no weapon. ” In an interview on Friday, the family’s lawyers said Ms. Scott was unaware that Mr. Scott owned a firearm. And one of his children said numerous times in a cellphone video she recorded in the aftermath of the shooting that he did not have a gun. Critics have accused officers of planting the gun. If Mr. Scott had a gun, was that allowed under federal and North Carolina laws? No. Although the North Carolina Supreme Court has recognized a general right to carry a firearm openly for nearly 100 years, there are exceptions, including ones related to criminal history, drug use or immigration status, under federal and state laws. Mr. Scott effectively forfeited his right to carry a gun in 2005, when he was convicted in the shooting of a man in San Antonio and sentenced to prison. Police officers on the scene last week in Charlotte almost certainly did not know about Mr. Scott’s legal history before they confronted him. A number of critics have wondered why officers would confront a man with a gun in an   state. But experts said it was not unreasonable for officers to investigate Mr. Scott’s possession of a firearm, even in a state that allows open carry, if they also believed he had marijuana. “If you see a person with drugs in one hand and a firearm in the other, I think that gives you a basis for thinking that a violation of federal law has occurred, and there might also be state crimes,” said Jeffrey B. Welty, an associate professor of public law and government at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “If it is the case, as the police have represented, that they confronted a person who had drugs and a weapon at the same time, then no, I don’t think there’s any question that that set of facts would support an investigative stop or an effort to speak further with that person,” he said. Does North Carolina permit marijuana? North Carolina law forbids possession of marijuana, but the police said on Saturday that the officers did not “consider Mr. Scott’s drug activity to be a priority” and approached him only after seeing the firearm. If Mr. Scott had been arrested for drug possession, the severity of the charge would have depended on the quantity of marijuana seized by the police. If he had enough for only one cigarette, the charge would have been a misdemeanor. The police have not explained why or how they assumed, from inside their unmarked vehicle, that Mr. Scott was rolling marijuana while sitting in the driver’s seat of his own vehicle. Did Mr. Scott have a book? Although the police say Mr. Scott was holding a gun before he was shot, friends and family members have said that he actually had a book with him. At least one sign at the protests that swept through Charlotte last week declared, “IT WAS A BOOK. ” Chief Putney said no book was recovered from the scene. What do we know about Officer Vinson? Three facts seem particularly noteworthy about Officer Vinson: He is relatively new to the police force, he has a clean disciplinary history and he is, like Mr. Scott,  . Officer Vinson, a member of a   unit in the department’s metro division, was placed on administrative leave after the shooting, a standard procedure here and across the country. The police said he joined the department in 2014, and has never been disciplined. Officer Vinson grew up in Charlotte, where, according to a profile published in 2012 in The Charlotte News and Advance, his father was the first black homicide detective on the police force here. As a high school student, Officer Vinson talked of a career in law enforcement and said he wanted to become a federal marshal. Over six feet tall, Officer Vinson’s formidable size served him as a college football player. After playing at Fork Union Military Academy, he enrolled at Liberty University, the Christian college founded by the evangelist Jerry Falwell. Officer Vinson graduated in 2013 with a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice and a master’s degree in executive leadership. What did Mr. Scott’s wife mean when she yelled, just before the shooting, “Keith, don’t do it”? This phrase, a variation of which Ms. Scott yells out numerous times in the cellphone video she made of the episode, has been the subject of intense speculation. Because Ms. Scott’s video is jerky and flits around the scene of the confrontation, it is hard to say what action Ms. Scott is asking her husband not to engage in. In the video, Ms. Scott can be heard telling her husband to get out of the S. U. V. so that the police will not break its windows. “Keith, don’t do it,” she says, while her husband is still inside the S. U. V. “Keith, get out the car! Keith, Keith, don’t you do it! Don’t you do it!” At that point, Mr. Scott can be seen getting out of the car. “Keith, Keith, Keith! Don’t you do it!” she says. Just as she finishes the sentence, the four shots ring out. Justin Bamberg, one of the lawyers for the family, said the statement was an effort to get Mr. Scott to stand still after he got out of the car. The dashboard camera video shows Mr. Scott walking backward before he is shot. What was Mr. Scott’s mental and physical state when the police confronted him? This is difficult to say conclusively, but some facts suggest that Mr. Scott may have been impaired in numerous ways. He suffered a traumatic brain injury last fall when he was involved in a motorcycle accident, neighbors and lawyers for his family said. His wife told officers during the confrontation that he had a “T. B. I. ,” or traumatic brain injury, and that he “just took his medicine. ” The family’s lawyers said they did not know what kind of medication he had taken. A photo of the marijuana cigarette released by the police on Saturday suggested that it had been smoked. Did the police offer medical assistance after the shooting? The Police Department said that officers performed CPR, but the footage that the authorities released on Saturday did not confirm or refute that assertion. The body camera recording showed that immediately after Mr. Scott was handcuffed, an officer asked for a bag and “some equipment. ” He soon added, as he gestured with a bloodied hand, “Get some gloves. We need to hold the wound. ” Mr. Scott was pronounced dead at a hospital later on Tuesday.",0
66322,Death of Australian Hughes ruled 'tragic accident',"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The death of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes was a ‘tragic accident’ and not as a result of a failure to enforce the rules of the game or inadequate safety equipment, the New South Wales (NSW) Coroner’s Court ruled on Friday. Hughes was hit on the back of the neck by a rising delivery when playing for South Australia in a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Nov. 25, 2014. He died two days later in a Sydney hospital. After reviewing the circumstances surrounding the incident to determine whether the 25-year-old’s death could have been avoided, NSW State Coroner Michael Barnes said he could find no evidence to support the view of Hughes’ family that he had died in a “very unsafe workplace”. “The family’s grief at losing their much loved son and brother was exacerbated by their belief that unfair play had contributed to his death,” said Barnes. “It is hoped that they accept the compelling evidence that the rules were complied with. Phillip was excelling at the crease as he so often did and that his death was a tragic accident.” The helmet worn by Hughes came under the spotlight following his death, though the NSW Coroner said the batsman’s death could not have been avoided by wearing different protective equipment.  Australia’s cricket board in May made it compulsory for players to wear helmets when facing fast and medium-paced bowling in line with recommendations from a review into the death of Hughes. The family had been angered that Hughes had been subjected to threatening language from an opponent and had suffered a sustained spell of aggressive short-pitched bowling that contravened the rules of the game.     Barnes accepted Hughes had received a barrage of short-pitch blowing, but all of which fell within the rules of the game. The court said it was unable to rule on whether Hughes had been subjected to threatening language, though Barnes said it was implausible that no “sledging” had occurred at all during the day. “Hopefully, the focus on this unsavoury aspect of the incident may cause those who claim to love the game to reflect upon whether the practice of sledging is worthy of its participants,” said Barnes.  “An outsider is left to wonder why such a beautiful game would need such an ugly underside.” ",0
3109, This Amazing Photo Shows The POWER Women Have When They Vote,"This photo shows the gravesite of Susan B. Anthony, the pioneering activist who tirelessly pushed for women s equality   specifically suffrage, the right to an equal vote   on the day of the 2016 presidential primary in New York.The photo shows a group of  I voted  stickers affixed to Anthony s tombstone, which is in Mount Hope Cemetery, in Rochester, NY.Greta Selin-Love, who posted the photo, said she  got a little weepy  looking at the picture as was  thinking back to all the work that Susan B. did for us. It is definitely worth noting that the photo comes on the same day that a woman who is very likely to be the first female president, Hillary Clinton, won the New York primary with over a million votes.Susan B. Anthony was born in 1820. She formed the Women s Loyal National League with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and quickly launched the largest petition drive up that point in American history, with 400,000 signatures demanding the abolition of slavery.Anthony followed that up with an organization demanding equal rights for women and blacks.Her activism in service of women s suffrage was launched after she was arrested in Rochester in 1872 for the crime of voting as a woman, and went to trial because she refused to pay the fine. That led to the creation of an amendment giving women the right to vote, which Anthony traveled around the country giving speeches pushing for.She died in 1906, unfortunately not seeing her dream realized. But in 1920, the Ninteenth Amendment became the law of the land, denying the right to deny anyone the right to vote based on their gender. It is only a few words, but they are powerful:The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.Anthony was later honored with her image on a U.S. postage stamp, and her face also appeared on $1 coins. But most importantly her legacy is felt every time a woman casts a ballot in America, ratifying over and over true equality.Featured image via Facebook ",1

High on Oracle’s list of new features:   analysis of enormous amounts of data. Oracle calls its product Oracle A. I. Elsewhere, General Electric is pushing its A. I. business, called Predix. IBM has ads featuring its Watson technology talking with Bob Dylan. These moves, along with similar projects at most major tech companies and consulting firms, represent years of work and billions in investment. There are big pushes in A. I. in agriculture, manufacturing, aviation and pretty much every other sector of the economy. It’s all very exciting, the way great possibilities are, and clearly full of great buzzwords and slogans. But will other companies see any value in all this or understand if A. I. has value for them? “No one really knows where the value is,” said Marc Benioff,   and chief executive of Salesforce. “I think I know  —   it’s in helping people do the things that people are good at, and turning more things over to machines. ” Mr. Benioff wasn’t selling Einstein’s capabilities short. He was talking about the   value of artificial intelligence, which is passing through a familiar phase  —   a technology that is strange and new, that sometimes overpromises what it can do and is headed for uses not easily seen at the start. Cloaked inside terms like deep learning and machine intelligence, A. I. is essentially a series of advanced   exercises that review the past to indicate the likely future, or look at current customer choices to figure out where to put more or less energy. Perhaps a better question than “What is the value?” of this explosion of advanced statistics is “Why now?” That shows both the opportunity and why many companies are scared about missing out. Much of today’s A. I. boom goes back to 2006, when Amazon started selling cheap computing over the internet. Those measures built the public clouds of Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, among others. That same year, Google and Yahoo released statistical methods for dealing with the unruly data of human behavior. In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone, a device that began a boom in   collection everywhere. Suddenly, old A. I. experiments were relevant, and money and cheap data resources were available for building new algorithms. Ten years later, computing is cheaper than ever, companies live online and in their phone apps, and sensors are bringing even more unruly data from more places. Amazon, Google and the rest have exceptional A. I. resources for sale, but many older companies are wary of turning their data over to these upstarts. That, along with fear of a competitor getting on top of A. I. first, is a big motivation for some to try things out. Salesforce is selling Einstein as a system that can work predictive magic without having to look at your data, in what Mr. Benioff calls a “democratizing” move that will create millions of A. I. users who are not engineers. He said this on his way to attend a series of customer focus groups around the country, however  —   strong evidence that customers don’t get it yet, even if they’re willing to try it. “There’s fear of Google and Microsoft controlling everything, and there’s a desire to apply A. I. to anything that’s digital,” said Michael Biltz, managing director of Accenture’s technology vision practice. “People are going to have to experiment, most likely first on pain points like security and product marketing. ” How will we know when the A. I. revolution has taken hold? A technology truly matures when it disappears. We don’t marvel at houses with electricity now, or the idea of driving to work at 60 miles an hour. We can say “phone” and mean a   computer with   processing power and a   camera for taking selfies with our drones. A. I. is probably heading for the same places, invisibly sorting through lots of data everywhere to continuously update and automate most of our lives. Goodness knows what the weird new tech thing will be about at that point.",0
