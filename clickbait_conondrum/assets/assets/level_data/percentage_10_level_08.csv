20260, KKK Just Threatened An 84-Year-Old Woman Who Fled Hitler After She Criticized Trump,"An elderly Massachussetts woman who wrote a letter to the Boston Globe denouncing Donald Trump now fears for her life after the Ku Klux Klan responded to her legitimate criticism of their favored presidential candidate. Louise Mayerson has been through a lot in her 84 years on this planet, coming from a  family who was forced to flee Austria when she was a child to escape Adolf Hitler s regime   but now she is forced to relive the terror her family felt as they fled the Nazis.Mayerson  s letter, published March 2, criticizes Trump s initial reticence in denouncing the numerous, numerous white supremacists who have publicly endorsed him:I AM an Austrian refugee from the time of Hitler who has been a US citizen for more than 70 years. I have found some alarming rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that is apparently finding approval from large numbers of my fellow Americans. With Trump s rather ambiguous response concerning his disavowal of the support of former Klansman David Duke, I have reached my breaking point ( Trump wavers on disavowing ex-KKK member,  Page A2, Feb. 29).We all know the opinions and actions the Ku Klux Klan stands for. Among the fellow Americans the KKK has sought out for its venom are American Jews. Trump s failure to immediately repudiate Duke chilled my blood.I can see myself needing to flee once more and perhaps return to my native country in Europe, where hateful rhetoric is now strictly forbidden and punishable by law. My outrage grows and grows and grows,  Mayerson said in an interview following the publication of her letter.  And it s flamed by the irresponsible actions, frankly, of Donald Trump. Unfortunately, the 84-year-old s expression of her completely legitimate misgivings about Trump s association with white supremacists was enough to throw them into a fit of rage. Days later, she received an envelop postmarked in Boston, There was no return address   after all, the Klan isn t exactly known for being forthcoming with their identities. There wasn t even a letter. Enclosed was a single Klan symbol: I believe somebody just read that letter, it touched a nerve, and that s the way they reacted,  Mayerson said. She contacted Arlington police, who are currently investigating the matter. They also contacted the Human Rights Commission, which assists hate crime victims. Mayerson says she is pleased with law enforcement s response, and that she is distressed by the   poisonous atmosphere that has been created  by Trump s rhetoric that can   lead to some pretty unpleasant things for all of us. Robert O. Trestan, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, says that Trump s rhetoric will help this sort of thing to become commonplace: The more that hateful and denigrating speech becomes commonplace in the public realm from leaders, the greater the likelihood that people will start acting up, whether it s harassment via the mail or violence. A Trump spokeswoman refused to comment on the incident, though she did point out that the candidate did finally denounce his David Duke endorsement after he was unable to handle the media scrutiny: Mr. Trump has disavowed David Duke, the KKK and all other groups that espouse similar views. He will continue to do so. Trump may say he disavows the KKK and other white supremacists, but in the past he has tweeted some of their propaganda. In fact, based on a week of data collection, 62 percent of the people Trump retweets are white supremacists. Unfortunately, The Donald is exactly the sort of person who is popular with the White Power Rangers in the United States   and as long as we tolerate his hate speech, we can expect that this sort of thing will become the new normal.Featured image via YouTube",1
55091,U.S. lawmaker wants hearing on bill to curb shell company abuse,"(Reuters) - A U.S. lawmaker has called for a congressional committee to hold a hearing on legislation that would make it easier for law enforcement to identify legal owners of shell companies to curb future abuse. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, made the request in a letter dated April 20 to House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a Republican from Texas.  The letter, seen by Reuters, came weeks after the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists worked with media outlets including The Guardian and BBC to report on 11.5 million leaked documents from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca.  The documents contained information on about 214,000 offshore companies and showed how individuals and corporations were able to hide assets and avoid taxes. The documents have come to be known as the Panama Papers. Maloney wrote in a letter that data from the leak also “highlight the ease with which criminals and corrupt officials can use anonymous shell companies to hide assets from law enforcement.”  A spokeswoman for Rep. Hensarling did not respond to a request for comment. “It is important to remember that for individuals and companies that have been blacklisted by the U.S. government, anonymous shell companies are one of the only ways for them to effectively move their money around the world - money that is often associated with corruption, drug trafficking, and even terrorist activity,” Maloney said in the letter. In February, Maloney and Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, reintroduced legislation that would require the U.S. Treasury Department to collect information about owners of shell companies, in the event that states are not already doing so. Another version of the bill, sponsored by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, would require states to identify and collect information about legal owners of companies formed through state laws. In an April 14 letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, Whitehouse also called for a hearing. Neither Maloney nor the Whitehouse have authority to schedule hearings. Earlier versions have been circulating in Congress since at least 2008 when then-Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, sought to crack down on shell company abuse in states with liberal incorporation laws. States have fiercely opposed efforts that would require them to collect identifying information, calling for the Internal Revenue Service to do so instead, among other alternatives. Separately, the Treasury Department inched closer on Friday toward finalizing a rule requiring banks to identify legal owners of shell companies. ",0

66187,Trump trade officials prefer tri-lateral NAFTA deal: U.S. senators,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s top trade officials hope to keep the North American Free Trade Agreement as a trilateral deal in negotiations with Canada and Mexico to revamp the 23-year-old pact, senators said on Tuesday. Several members of the Senate Finance Committee said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and new U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told them in a closed door meeting that they would prefer the current three-nation format but left open the possibility of parallel bilateral agreements with Canada and Mexico. “Their preference is trilateral,” Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow told reporters after the meeting. Republican Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa said from the meeting it sounded to him as if a trilateral deal was more likely “unless there’s problems” with that approach. “If trilaterally you aren’t getting anyplace, I suppose then you do it bilaterally,” Grassley said. Ross, who has floated the idea of doing two bilateral trade deals with Canada and Mexico, declined to confirm the administration’s preference for a trilateral approach. “Right now it is a trilateral deal and we shall see what comes in the future but the important thing is to get to the substance,” Ross told reporters after leaving the meeting, adding that talks would be “long and complicated.” The meeting was one of several on Capitol Hill this week involving Lighthizer, who was sworn in as U.S. trade representative on Monday, that are required for the Trump administration to trigger the start of the NAFTA negotiating process with a 90-day consultation period. Farm state senators said they also warned Ross and Lighthizer not to take actions that would damage agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico.  “We made it pretty clear that’s a priority, that we don’t want to see ag hurt,” said Senator John Thune, a South Dakota Republican. “NAFTA by and large has been good for agriculture, and we’re seeing some disruptions in the ag marketplace today because of uncertainty about where this is headed.” Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the Finance Committee’s top Democrat, said Ross and Lighthizer assured him they would push to drop NAFTA’s dispute-resolution mechanism. Trump has complained that the mechanism is biased against the United States. ",0
32209,AMERICAN EVIL,"Share This: By Joe Giambrone What if everything printed this year about Donald J. Trump was 100% true, yet Hillary Clinton still wound up being the greater evil? What then America? 
If the American people are to purchase a product, then do they not have a right to know just how much lesser this “evil” actually weighs versus the name brand? 
Like those seasonal Cadbury Cream Eggs that old familiar product has returned to the shelves: lesser evil, with more fat and toxins this year than ever. This repackaged, re-branded item is what many Americans claim to want every four years, the only thing they ever want or care about politically, and they attack those who refuse to purchase it. It’s rather like a Black Friday zombie frenzy descending on Walmart, but we are told by TV that this is “democracy.” It’s not. It’s oligarchy with bread and circuses. 
The so-called “lesser evil” political philosophy is the only political philosophy these people seem to comprehend, but the core of the concept is overlooked. Their candidate of choice will admittedly commit evil acts. Do they not want to know what this alleged lesser evil entails? 
Seems like self-deception is intrinsic to supporting this little house of cards. Perhaps if the phrase was amended to “evil but possibly lesser,” which is in fact more accurate, the public would spend a few seconds thinking about it when these Novembers inevitably roll around. 
Is a nuclear holocaust “evil?” I suppose that’s the crux of the debate we face today. One of those big two evil candidates has repeatedly, and irrationally, tried to provoke hostilities against nuclear-armed Russia, as part of some unstated agenda: the real agenda that has been torching the Middle East for decades. Wars of western conquest, which turned millions into hamburger, didn’t just happen by themselves. Certain interests wanted to dismantle the oil-rich nations that considered themselves independent of Washington and the EU. The chaos of failed states was preferred to organized regimes that could form an independent bloc or fight back in any way.
According to Hillary R. Clinton, we should all be frothing at the Russians, and at Vladimir Putin for some set of vague claims without the substance that evidence would provide. Hillary and the Democratic National Committee were caught bloody-handed stealing the 2016 Democratic Party primary election from Bernie Sanders. Fraud. The only response she has mustered is the single word “Putin.” Yeah, sure: Putin did it. Repeated so often the word has lost all meaning here in the states, but abroad these quite undiplomatic slights do not pass unnoticed. 
T he Russians unveiled their next generation ICBM , “Satan 2,” capable of wiping out the central east coast of America, or all of France, or the UK, or most of California. You get the idea, but does Hillary Clinton ? 
She insists on a “no-fly zone” in Syria, which the Russian military has already imposed against the invading US coalition , the one which has been arming and funding multiple armies of mass-murdering terrorists! 
Clinton privately told Goldman Sachs : “ They’re getting more sophisticated thanks to Russian imports. To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we’re not putting our pilots at risk you’re going to kill a lot of Syrians… So all of a sudden this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and NATO involvement where you take a lot of civilians.” 
In the name of protecting civilians HRC wants to kill a lot of civilians and attack Russian-supplied air defense systems, and Russian military personnel of course. The fraud that Hillary Clinton and the interests she represents care in any way about dead Syrian civilians is laughable on its face. US foreign policy has never, ever been based upon protecting the lives of foreign nobodies. To believe such a fairy tale would require complete, absolute historical ignorance. But then again we’re talking about the American public. 
How “Evil” is Hillary Clinton already? A merican corporate media refuses to call US war crimes war crimes. One can be impeached for a blowjob, but not for killing Nazi-level numbers of foreigners. There is no death count too high for the US Congress not to condone, if not to encourage. US foreign policy has never, ever been based upon protecting the lives of foreign nobodies. To believe such a fairy tale would require complete, absolute historical ignorance. But then again we’re talking about the American public. 
Hillary Rodham Clinton has already played an instrumental role in the mass murders of approximately two million people, give or take. The Third Reich didn’t bother with accurate tallies of its victims either. This figure shocks self-styled “liberal” Americans so thoroughly that they simply refuse to believe it. 
Clinton, as Senator, not only voted for an illegal war on Iraq (command responsibility), but she told “weapons of mass destruction” lies , selling the fraud to Democrats (lying to Congress). Estimates of Iraqi casualties range from half a million to a million and a half. The carnage continues to this day, and Crimes Against the Peace attribute responsibility for all the evil that results from initiating a war of aggression . This is codified in the UN Charter, and that makes Hillary Clinton also an international war criminal, just like Bush, just like Cheney. The hypocrisy of those who condemned Bush and yet joyfully cast a vote for HRC is staggering (yet commonplace). 
That was only one war. As Secretary of State Clinton took on even more responsibility for international crimes, notably the assault on Libya , another war of aggression. 
As the Russians noted , there was never any permission to bomb ground targets and help Al Qaeda linked rebels take over the country. “We’re witnessing a large number of violations of the resolutions of the UN Security Council. Over the last few days, there have been reports of the NATO air force bombing civilian targets, including hospitals… This is an unacceptable situation; the United Nations Security Council did not authorize any such thing. Attempts to justify what’s happening by claiming that the coalition does not go beyond the mandate are insufficient.” 
-Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov… 
“Regime change” is a war crime , not an item on a menu for neocons to simply order up. Between 10 and 30,000 Libyans were massacred in the NATO-assisted destruction of Libya. Hillary Clinton displayed a gloating psychosis at the climax of the bloodletting. 
Onto Syria, with a current corpse count of 470,000. What was Hillary Clinton’s role? Seymour Hersh’s reporting contrasts against the endless lies of politicians: 
“ A highly classified annex to the report, not made public, described a secret agreement reached in early 2012 between the Obama and Erdogan administrations. It pertained to the rat line. By the terms of the agreement, funding came from Turkey, as well as Saudi Arabia and Qatar; the CIA, with the support of MI6, was responsible for getting arms from Gaddafi’s arsenals into Syria… The annex didn’t tell the whole story of what happened in Benghazi… ‘The consulate’s only mission was to provide cover for the moving of arms,’ the former intelligence official, who has read the annex, said. ‘It had no real political role.’” 
Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was deeply involved in this covert “regime change” plot, and the sequential wars resulting from it. To this day she insists on continuing the plot to overthrow Bashar Al Assad, the elected President of Syria. 
During her husband’s administration another half-million Iraqi children were killed as a result of US imposed sanctions on medicine and water filtration components. That UN death toll figure was deemed “worth it” by Madeleine Allbright in one of the most shocking news clips of the modern age. This unindicted yet confessed mass murderer campaigns openly for Hillary Clinton . 
There are other flash points where Hillary Clinton had a role, Haiti and Honduras for example. Scandals and atrocities have been reported, but this does not faze her supporters, nor most Americans who care nothing about the illegitimate actions of the US empire abroad. 
So Donald Trump’s a pig, and the free world must play pretend that Hillary R. Clinton is not a proven and dangerous war criminal. Hollywood leads the charge and attacks dissenters. 
How deluded is America this year and how evil?

71528,HILARIOUS! CNN President Jeff Zucker Is Hitler [VIDEO],"CNN s ratings have been in the toilet ever since they made falsifying news about our President and his nonexistent Russian connection a top priority. Earlier this week, CNN sunk to a new low when they threatened to release the identity of a private user on social media site Reddit, after he made a video showing President Trump body-slamming a CNN logo superimposed over the WWE Chairman s body. Perhaps it s a good time for CNN to think about replacing their vengeful, bully president CNN s president, Jeff Zucker, responded to the fiasco surrounding his network this week with a jab President Donald Trump s way, asserting it s the White House chief who s the aggressor in this tiff   that the news organization is the victim.Zucker s like the playground bully, caught mid-punch, mid-push, now standing before the principal, trying to weasel out of blame.  My job is to remind everyone that they need to stay focused doing their job,  Zuckersaid to The New York Times.  [Trump s] trying to bully us, and we re not going to let him intimidate us. You can t lose your confidence and let that change the way you conduct yourselves. Decoded meaning: CNN s not going to change their witch-hunting ways.The whole tiff is over a video clip that Trump retweeted showing him wrestling CNN to the ground. The media, as the media is wont to do, went overboard with the criticism of Trump s retweet, pretending like he was calling for arms against members of the media.CNN then went on a hunt to identify the creator of this video, watchdogging like it s not watchdogged in years. And once identified, the guy was then issued this rather cold, calculating message from CNN: Behave, or we ll name you publicly.Watch Infowars  hilarious  FAKE NEWS  video that replaces the Hitler character with CNN president Jeff Zucker: Hitler reacts to CNN pic.twitter.com/zyjdJTknAN  Trump in 2020 (@GOPin2020) July 8, 2017The hashtag #CNNBlackmail quickly gathered steam on Twitter.

45047,U.S. MOSQUE LINKED TO TERRORIST GROUP Received $2.7 MILLION In Federal Funding,"It s interesting to note the terrorist organization linked to this mosque (and funded with our taxpayer dollars), is same terror group Obama and the Democrats supported during the Arab Spring uprising in Egypt A Kansas City mosque owned by an Islamic umbrella organization with deep ties to the U.S. arm of the Muslim Brotherhood has received millions of dollars in federal grants over the past several years, according to a federal spending database.The Islamic Center of Greater Kansas City has received $2,739,891 from the Department of Agriculture since 2010, a Daily Caller analysis has found. The money largely went to the mosque s Crescent Clinic to provide services through the Women, Infant and Children nutrition program, known as WIC.The most recent federal payment   in the amount of $327,436   was handed out Oct. 1. Property records show the mosque is owned by the North American Islamic Trust (NAIT), which acts as a financial holding company for Islamic organizations. It offers sharia-compliant financial products to Muslim investors, operates Islamic schools and owns more than 300 other mosques throughout the U.S.Founded in 1973 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood-backed Muslim Students Association, NAIT s most controversial connection is to the 2007 and 2008 Holy Land Foundation terror financing cases. Along with other Muslim Brotherhood-linked organizations like the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), NAIT was named a co-conspirator in the federal case but was not indicted.At the Holy Land Foundation trial, evidence was presented that ISNA diverted funds from the accounts it held with NAIT to institutions linked to Hamas and to Mousa Abu Marzook, a senior Hamas leader.Federal prosecutors introduced evidence in the case that  established that ISNA and NAIT were among those organizations created by the U.S.-Muslim Brotherhood.  Hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of checks drawn from ISNA s account and deposited in the Holy Land Foundation s account with NAIT were made payable to  the Palestinian Mujahadeen,  which is the original name for Hamas  military wing.While Hamas was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government in 1997 and is considered the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, the larger Muslim Brotherhood is not itself designated as a terrorist group.And while the Obama administration has largely remained agnostic towards the organization, the British government released a scathing report earlier this month noting that the Muslim Brotherhood remains supportive of Hamas and that much of its ideology and many of its tactics  are contrary to our values and have been contrary to our national interests and our national security.

62325,BILL NYE The FAKE Science Guy THREATENS Conservatives…Blue States Will “Impose Economic Sanctions” Against Climate Change Denying States,"Friday on MSNBC, climate activist Bill Nye warned conservatives to  watch out,  saying progressive blue states will  address climate change  on their own.Nye said,  Only 40 percent of people in the U.S. think that Congress should be addressing this and that s because certain conservative groups, especially from the fossil fuel industry, have been very successful in introducing the idea that scientific uncertainty, plus or minus two percent, is the same as plus or minus 100 percent. He continued,  There s a lot of emphasis from conservatives on what are writ-large states rights. Just watch out, conservatives, if states rights include California, Illinois, New York   these places that, where people voted in a progressive fashion   watch out if all those places start to address climate change and then impose economic sanctions, either overtly or by default, on places that have not embraced the work that needs to be done. Then you ll end up with this states rights working the other way. He added,  We ve got to remind people that we re all in this together. The people I think about all the time are what are eloquently stated as the hillbillies. We want to engage everybody. Not working to address climate change is in no one s best interest. It is not in the best interest, especially of your children and grandchildren. A couple of times you mentioned that I am against the president and so on. I m not especially against the president. I just think he s gotten himself surrounded by people who are willing to mortgage the future, to let the people who are coming into the workforce now pay for the future. This is true, not just with regard to the national debt, which will almost certainly increase the same way it tripled under the beloved Ronald Reagan, not only will that national debt increase, but the climate debt, in a sense, what we have to do to address climate change, will be more and more difficult to pay back or pay down.    Breitbart NewsThe climate change debate went nuclear last year, over a whistleblower s explosive allegation that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association manipulated data to advance a political agenda by hiding the global warming  pause. In an article on the Climate Etc. blog, John Bates, who retired last year as principal scientist of the National Climatic Data Center, accused the lead author of the 2015 NOAA  pausebuster  report of trying to  discredit  the hiatus through  flagrant manipulation of scientific integrity guidelines and scientific publication standards. In addition, Mr. Bates told the Daily [U.K.] Mail that the report s author, former NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information director Thomas Karl, did so by  insisting on decisions and scientific choices that maximized warming and minimized documentation. Gradually, in the months after [the report] came out, the evidence kept mounting that Tom Karl constantly had his  thumb on the scale    in the documentation, scientific choices, and release of datasets   in an effort to discredit the notion of a global warming hiatus and rush to time the publication of the paper to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy,  Mr. Bates said Saturday on Climate Etc.The June 2015 report,  Possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus,  which updated the ocean temperature record, was published six months before the U.N. s Paris summit.The accusations sparked a fierce back-and-forth Sunday between so-called climate warmists and skeptics over the validity and implications of Mr. Bates  claim, which he defended on the Climate Etc. blog run by former Georgia Tech climatologist Judith Curry.Zeke Hausfather, Berkeley Earth climate scientist, said in a Sunday  fact-check  on the CarbonBrief blog that the Karl paper s conclusions  have been validated by independent data from satellites, buoys, and Argo floats and many other independent groups. While NOAA s data management procedures may well need improvement, their results have been independently validated and agree with separate global temperature records created by other groups,  Mr. Hausfather said, citing Berkeley Earth and the U.K. s Met Office Hadley Centre.He said the record  strongly suggests that NOAA got it right and that we have been underestimating ocean warming in recent years. Meanwhile, the whistleblowing prompted a  we-told-you-so  moment from Republicans on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee who have long suspected the Obama administration of retroactively fiddling with climate data in order to erase the 1998-2013 pause in global temperature increases. Now that Dr. Bates has confirmed that there were heated disagreements within NOAA about the quality and transparency of the data before publication, we know why NOAA fought transparency and oversight at every turn,  said Chairman Lamar Smith in a Sunday statement.The panel launched an investigation into the NOAA pausebuster report after whistleblowers said the study was  rushed to publication before underlying data issues were resolved to help influence public debate about the so-called Clean Power Plan and upcoming Paris climate conference. Dr. Bates  revelations and NOAA s obstruction certainly lend credence to what I ve expected all along   that the Karl study used flawed data, was rushed to publication in an effort to support the president s climate change agenda and ignored NOAA s own standards for scientific study,  Mr. Smith said.Mr. Bates said he decided to come forward after reading a Washington Post article Dec. 13 that said federal scientists are  frantically copying U.S. climate data, fearing it might vanish under Trump. As a climate scientist formerly responsible for NOAA s climate archive, the most critical issue in archival of climate data is actually scientists who are unwilling to formally archive and document their data,  he said on Climate Etc.In his experience, the  most serious example of a climate scientist not archiving or documenting a critical climate dataset was the study of Tom Karl et al. 2015 (hereafter referred to as the Karl study or K15), purporting to show no  hiatus  in global warming in the 2000s. NOAA did not return immediately Sunday a request for comment. The Daily Mail said that Mr. Karl  admitted the data had not been archived when the paper was published  but denied trying to influence the climate summit. Asked why he had not waited, he said:  John Bates is talking about a formal process that takes a long time. He denied he was rushing to get the paper out in time for Paris, saying:  There was no discussion about Paris,  said the Daily Mail article.The American Geophysical Union issued a statement saying it was  very closely monitoring the situation, have considered the possible implications, and will be sharing any new information or response by AGU with you here.

52416,"Ratgeber: Alles, was Sie jetzt über die US-Wahl wissen müssen","Dienstag, 8. November 2016 Ratgeber: Alles, was Sie jetzt über die US-Wahl wissen müssen Für die USA ist es ein Schicksalstag: Heute entscheidet sich, ob Donald Trump oder Hillary Clinton in das Weiße Haus einziehen wird. Doch wie genau funktioniert eigentlich die Präsidentschaftswahl in den USA? Hier erfahren Sie alles, was Sie jetzt wissen müssen: Warum wird in den USA an einem Dienstag gewählt? Die Amerikaner wählen nicht dienstags, sondern - wie die meisten anderen Länder auch - am Sonntag. Durch die Zeitverschiebung von rund zwei Tagen zwischen den USA (General Motor Time) und Deutschland (Mittelhochdeutsche Winterzeit) ist es nur für uns Dienstag. Wann genau erfahre ich hier in Deutschland, wer die US-Wahl gewonnen hat? Voraussichtlich im Herbst 2028. Spätestens dann sollte der auf die Wahl folgende Bürgerkrieg ausgefochten und einer der beiden Kandidaten siegreich aus dem Gemetzel hervorgegangen sein. Ich habe keine Wahlbenachrichtigung erhalten. Was ist nun zu tun? Laut Ihrer IP-Adresse und Ihren Facebook-Posts leben Sie nicht in den USA. Die US-Wahlen sind - wie der Name schon sagt - US-Bürgern vorbehalten. Ach so! Wer darf denn dann wählen? Wählen darf in den USA jeder Mensch, der folgende Voraussetzungen erfüllt: - Über 18 Jahre alt: So hat jeder drei Jahre Zeit, um das Wahlsystem kennenzulernen, bevor er seine Frustration ab seinem 21. Geburtstag mit Alkohol betäuben darf. - US-Bürger: Bürger der USA wird man entweder durch Geburt oder durch Ritterschlag der Königin von Amerika. - Patriot: Wer kein Patriot ist, darf nicht wählen. Um als Patriot anerkannt zu werden, muss man mindestens einmal nachweislich Sex mit der US-amerikanischen Flagge gehabt haben. - Jemand anderes als Sie: Wer Sie ist, darf nicht wählen. Also vergessen Sie's einfach. Achtung: Jeder US-Bürger hat nur EINE Stimme. Das heißt, dass Bürger, die schon bei einer der letzten Präsidentschaftswahlen abgestimmt haben, automatisch disqualifiziert sind. Wird der US-Präsident direkt gewählt? Nein, der US-Präsident wird nicht direkt vom Volk gewählt. Das Volk wählt lediglich sogenannte Wahlmänner, die wiederum innerhalb von 14 Tagen einen ihrer Freunde damit beauftragen müssen, einen geeigneten Nachbarn auszusuchen, dessen Tante väterlicherseits dann auf dem großen Tantenkonvent in Washington DC gemeinsam mit den anderen entsandten Tanten den Präsidenten bestimmt. Nachteil für den Wähler: Dadurch kann es passieren, dass jemand Präsident wird, den man selbst gar nicht gewählt hat. Was passiert bei Gleichstand? Bei Gleichstand der Stimmen dürfen beide Endkandidaten zusammen US-Präsident sein. In der Geschichte der USA kam das lediglich einmal vor (1945-53: Truman/Capote). Was hilft gegen Schluckauf? Es gibt diverse Hausmittel. So soll es zum Beispiel helfen, den/die Betroffene/n zu erschre… Moment mal! Bitte nur Fragen zur US-Wahl! Menno! Na gut: Welche Bundesstaaten sind am 8. November entscheidend? Spannend wird es insbesondere in den sogenannten Swing-States. Sie heißen so, weil sie wie das Pendel einer Uhr unkontrolliert über dem Gebiet der USA herumschwingen. Da die Wähler, denen es ohnehin von früh bis spät speiübel ist, aufgrund der heftigen Schwingbewegung ihres Staates große Schwierigkeiten haben, ihr Kreuz bei dem Kandidaten zu machen, den sie wählen wollen, gelten sie als unkalkulierbar. Folgende Staaten gelten als Swing-States: East Virginia, Montezuma, Haribo, Ohiowa, Old Baconshire, Guantanamo und New Vada Es war so viel von möglichem Wahlbetrug die Rede – ist das wahrscheinlich? Wahlbetrug im großen Stil im Sinne einer mehrfachen oder unberechtigten Stimmabgabe ist nach Meinung aller Experten sehr unwahrscheinlich. Echte Profis manipulieren die Wahl, indem BUH! Ist der Schluckauf weg?... äh, weiter im Text: indem sie der Bevölkerung etwa versprechen, ihr Land wieder großartig zu machen, ohne näher darauf einzugehen, wie das gelingen soll. Welche Auswirkungen hat der Ausgang der Wahl auf Deutschland? Egal, wer die Wahl gewinnt: Als Deutscher dürfen Sie sich grundsätzlich überlegen fühlen und die Wähler in den USA für ihre Dummheit verachten. Ob der Atomkrieg mit Russland am Ende aus geostrategischen Hardliner-Positionen entsteht (Clinton) oder das Ende einer Twitterfehde mit Wladimir Putin ist (Trump), spielt ohnehin keine große Rolle. ssi, dan, pfg, fed",1
12542, Trump’s Leaks To Russia May Well Have Put Individual Lives In Serious Danger,"Trump s ignorance, incompetence, and ego are putting intelligence agents at risk.It won t come as any surprise that international espionage is a complicated, high-stakes affair. At any given time, agents from countries all around the world are embedded with ISIS and other terrorist groups, secretly reporting back to their superiors in order to ensure that America and her allies have the latest intelligence. As the New York Times and Addicting Info have reported, the intelligence that President Trump shared with the Russians came from Israeli sources. That s a problem.Iran is one of Israel s greatest enemies and one of Russia s biggest allies. They certainly have an interest in learning everything they can about Israeli intelligence assets. And now, thanks to Donald Trump s startling incompetence, their Russian allies are free to tell them everything they know.The Wall Street Journal s statement confirming Israeli intelligence was the source.This sort of intelligence breach is literally unprecedented. Until now, no American president has ever handled classified information so carelessly. But that s not the worst of it. Israeli field agents have been compromised thanks to Trump s propensity for gossip. Sources say that they re being recalled right now, forced to flee from the ISIS units in which they ve worked so hard to embed themselves.One of the biggest ironies about this ongoing story is just how many intelligence officials worried it was going to happen. Stories have broken since the election last year that quote intelligence sources saying they were worried about Trump s stupidity.It was NOT appropriate 4 Trump 2 disclose this intel to Russia. It was NOT ours to share. It was Israel's, provided on high confidentiality.  Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) May 16, 2017One article, which ran in Israeli newspaper Haaretz and was written by investigative reporter Ronen Bergman, mentions this exact scenario, complete with a warning from American intelligence agents not to trust Trump.

12255,PA Kids’ Drawings: Israel Drinks Blood of Palestinians,"Reprinted from Palestinian Media Watch . 
Fatah has posted several children's drawings on Facebook. The drawings clearly show the success of PA and Fatah brainwashing children to believe that Israel only seeks to harm them, violence is good and that all of Israel really is ""Palestine."" Labeling the drawings ""innocent drawings"" that ""express the feelings of children of #Palestine,"" Fatah posted the drawing above showing Israel, as indicated by a Star of David, eating a Palestinian body wrapped in the Palestinian flag. Blood is seen coming from the body, and a glass of blood is next to the plate.Another drawing by a Palestinian child showed a crucified woman wearing the colors of the Palestinian flag, with her body in the shape of the PA map of ""Palestine"" that presents all of Israel as ""Palestine"" together with the PA areas. The crucifixion also repeats the analogy that Palestinians are Martyr victims like Jesus . Yet other drawings showed support for violence as legitimate means of Palestinian opposition to Israel. One child drew a Palestinian with a slingshot, another drew a hand with a rifle (see below). These drawings echo the PA and Fatah's encouragement of the use of violence against Israel and their glorification of terrorists as heroes. Palestinian Media Watch documented that summer camps organized by the PA Ministry of Education and the PLO educated children to see terrorist stabbers as role models . 
Other drawings repeated the world view that all of Israel is ""Palestine,"" showing the PA map of ""Palestine"" which completely erases the existence of Israel and its legitimacy (see below). This message is repeated endlessly by the PA and Fatah. Children are told that "" it will all return to us "" on kids' TV programs. The PA National Security Forces regularly post photos from all over Israel presenting the places as ""Palestine,"" and even crossword puzzles portray Israeli cities as ""occupied Palestine."" 
The PA's exploitation of Palestinian children's innocence is precisely what PMW has been highlighting and warning about for years. The PA and Fatah repeatedly demonize Israel as a monster whose only intention is to harm Palestinians. Israel is "" Satan with a tail "" on PA TV children's programs and "" Satan's project "" fighting ""Allah's project"" in sermons delivered by Mahmoud Abbas' advisor. Similarly, Palestinian terrorist murderers are being portrayed as innocent victims of alleged Israeli "" executions ."" A few of the drawings included doves, some calling for ""peace and freedom."" A major focus of Palestinian Authority policy today is to demand freedom for all imprisoned Palestinian terrorists including murderers. One drawing specifies ""Freedom for Ahmad Manasrah"" - a child terrorist who stabbed and critically wounded two Israelis, one of them a 13-year-old boy.",1
46029,Comment on Europe’s Forgotten ‘Hitler’ Killed Over 10 Million Africans — But the West Erased it From History by chris VN,"Black Emanuelle fixed all that in 1976. Attila 
Speaking of Europeans Colonialism/exploitation and the Ottomans. Your Europe is only Western Europe. Eastern European countries were not colonizers. They never adventured outside of the continent either and never been in the slavery business. They were colonized, brutalized and saved by Asians inducing the Mongol Empire and the Muslim Ottoman Empire. So please refer to Western Europe only when you speak of Europe. Eastern Europeans were often the victims of none-whites and Islamic imperialism. Ever wondered why Hungary is not accepting any Muslim migrants? Attren 
Atilla, will you please be so kind as to reference some quality literature on this subject? I am most interested and want to learn more (eastern european). Thank you, brother. Attila 
Google the Mongol invasion of Hungary and Eastern Europe also the Ottoman period in Eastern Europe. Bob Btme 
I’m familiar with the story of the guy playing the trumpet in Poland who got the arrow in the neck. The history of the ancient cannabis- using Scythian marauders is also interesting, Bob Btme 
thanks Attila for educating us on that, I love history and barely received any during my 17 years spent in the USA public school system Rod 
The reason your not taught accurate history in school is that the book writers are formerly propaganda and car salesmen teachers. All one has to do is research the history of said companies like McGraw Hill and such. Sloane 
Attila is half telling the truth and half over-simplifying/lying Sloane 
Attila is clearly deranged. You shouldn’t believe much of what he writes. Daniel Sandman 
hmm.. wouldn’t the Visigoths count as eastern Europeans? They brought down the west roman empire and colonized it. And what about those Vandals? Attila 
There were many ethnic groups living in the Carpathian base or what is now Eastern Europe before Christian Europe was born. There were the Avars, Cumans, Gepids and many others who were pagans and did not have a state. They came and left. When Hungary and other Eastern European accepted Christianity and formed their own country that’s the time they joined Europe and stayed and had their kingdoms. That’s when countries become accountable. I’m concerned about Christian Europe because that’s what Europe is today. That’s what we protected and sacrificed so much for. Alejandra 
What do you think about your christian europe and the genocide at america? Attila 
You mean Western European colonial powers? As an Eastern European who’s people suffered genocide from Asians ans Muslims and were left alone to defend Europe and betrayed by Western Europe I say some of those countries owe us a apology. France formed the Franco-Ottoman alliance basically legalizing our enslavement by the Muslim Ottomans. They betrayed Christian Europe and us Hungarians and the Serbians, Bulgarians, Romanians and Poles. France and some of the Western European colonial countries were not true Christians. If they were they would not let us to be enslaved by the Islamic Ottoman Empire. Funny how France was the first congratulating Suleiman the Magnificent after he defeated the Hungarians at Mohacs in 1526. Yes slavery was legal in the Ottoman Empire and France had no problem teaming up with our slave master and have our country turn in to a wasteland. Eastern Europeans don’t think highly of Western Europeans. Eastern Europeans whites are proud people. niels groenbaek 
This old Europe was bad. France, Belgium did leave every country/territory in a mess Attila 
Just imagine. Europe was under threat of being conquered by the Ottomans. The sultans openly expressed their desire to conquer Europe and convert i it to Islam. They dreamed of converting the Vatican in to a mosque. Then you have France who formed and alliance with them. They truly betrayed not only the Eastern European countries who came under Islamic terror but Europe and Christianity as well. chris VN 
They’ve stopped dreaming about it and have been doing it by stealth for the last 50 or so years. John L. Wildman 
You need to shut the fuck up till you know what you’re talking about. Simona Mamo 
The Raiders of the Ottoman empire also regularly raided Malta. We are a small island in the middle of the Mediterranean sea and stole the locals for slaves. Besides butchering and pillaging. Rod 
Much like columbus did to us native american “indians” I suppose. Simona Mamo 
Lol. Well previous to the Spanish invasion for lack of a better word, they themselves had just liberated the Iberian peninsula(Spain) from the Moorish empire. Sad how people who have themselves had to fight for so long to free themselves from a conqurer yoke so easily become conquers themselves. In fact I believe I read somewhere that Isabella sent Colombus off in the hope of new trade routes to India as she needed money for her continuing war against the Ottoman empire.Trouble in one region always seems to spread. Diesel67 
War against the Ottoman Empire took a back seat to getting rid of Jews. Much of the Spanish Jews expelled in 1492 migrated to the Ottoman lands, so much so that the Ottoman sultan said in substance: Ferdinand calls himself a clever king but he enriches my kingdom even as he impoverishes his own. Of course all that changed when the Spanish conquered most of the Americas, plundered its resources and enslaved or killed the indigenous population (no worse than any other conquering empire throughout history). Simona Mamo 
Lol. Colombus actually took a Jew with him on his voyage of exploration. Sloane 
Well wouldn’t geography play a big part in colonization? From what port could Hungary go and control a colony in Africa? Do you count Russians as Eastern Europeans? If so, then you can’t say Eastern European countries were not colonizers. Attila 
Most of Russia is in Asia just like Turkey. Russia didn’t slave or colonized African countries and was not in the slave trade at all. They didn’t commit genocide against non Russians either as a colonizer. They didn’t go further then some of their neighboring countries. The Soviet Union was bad but a different animal all together. Russia is not on the radar of progressive liberals and black activist who are the most vocal about the crimes of Colonialism. If you insist maybe I could say countries that are in Eastern Europe only or entirely Eastern European or central-East European countries. Sloane 
Russia didn’t slave or colonize African countries but part of that is that they couldn’t because of the Western Europeans already there (Russians DID attempt to try to expand into/colonize parts of Africa – https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1rpfwp/russian_colonialism_in_africa/ ). My point is that you’re oversimplifying history and victimizing Eastern Europeans in a thread about the Congo? Why? Have some respect and take your tirade elsewhere. Your post started with “Speaking of Europeans Colonialism/exploitation and the Ottomans.” This article wasn’t speaking about colonialism or the ottomans in general. You brought it in. “Hungary had ports on the Adriatic see for hundreds of years.” And you just proved how expansionist the Hungarians were! And people are supposed to have sympathy for poor E. Europeans because they didn’t get the chance to commit atrocities like their Western European counterparts? Give me a break! Attila 
You are one of those “useful idiots” aren’t you? Here is my solution for the idiots that includes many of the commentators also: Two words should not be used and those are WHITES and EUROPEANS. Instead use words like Western Europeans, Western European Colonial powers, Colonial Americans, Colonial Spain, England or what ever countries were the culprits. In the USA they should use words like European Americans, Western European Immigrants or Colonial Americans. Understand that your history is not our history and your crimes are not our crimes. Generalizing white Caucasians puts Eastern Europeans into the same category as a white slave keeper in colonial America hundreds of years ago or a Belgian murderer in Africa. It seems you have a sick need to drag down all white people and equal them to those who violated non-Whites. We are from the other half of Europe, from other countries with a totally different historical background and we have absolutely nothing to do with colonization and slavery. Do you understand the difference between Eastern Europe and Western Europe? To put it simple: West was the colonizer vs. East which was colonized. I’m asking you to be considerate of us and stop the anti-white bigotry.﻿ If progressives keep using terms such as legacy of European exploitation, white racism and many other insults I encourage that you talk to Eastern Europeans such as Poles, Czechs, Croats, Slovaks and Hungarians and ask them what they think about the practice of generalizing whites and Europeans. They will tell you that you are embarrassing and you don’t talk on their behalf. Don’t be surprised if they express their disgust if you try to patronize them like you are trying me. Believe me the the West have no idea just how low opinion Eastern Europeans have for the West because the anti-white narrative and views the West holds. The more Eastern European EU countries become mainstream the more we are going to oppose you and will not going to put up with racism that we don’t deserve. You can bet on it.﻿ You attempt to get sympathy for the victims of Congo while you trash Europe will not get any respect from us. As per your comment about having a port on the Adriatic sea at the expense of other nations just shows how little you know. Hungarians never treated Croatia as colony and certainly didn’t oppress or violated Croatians. It was a union that benefited both countries especially protecting the borders against the Islamic Imperialist. Why don’t you ask Croatians about what they think about it, you useful idiot. Sloane 
Uhh I am half-Croatian,half-Bosnian, born in Dubrovnik, you fascist waste of air. I never generalized white Caucasians or “trshed” Eastern Europeans. Look at my comments again and you’ll see who was the idiot. I’ll save you the trouble – it’s you 🙂 I entered into a conversation with you to see just how bad your historical knowledge is – and that is VERY bad. Your original comments hinted at your xenophobia and racism and your further comments proved it. I wish you the best, I wish you would read decent history books from ALL OVER eastern Europe, not just Hungary. You may learn something, you may learn to be less fearful of change. Fear is the worst thing and your comments are brimming with fear – fear of migrants, muslims, etc. Bye Attila 
Bosnian? That explains it: you are a Muslim or a Muslim sympathizer. That explains why are in denial and trying to push your agenda. You are just another progressive liberal who protects islamo fascist agenda because that’s your heritage. Islam is the ideology of our former slave master and pure evil ideology. You know we were called infidel dogs by your kind for 150 years. Even now all you can do is just freak out and bark like we were still dogs. Why not put yourself together and give an honest argument and a fact based debate. But I don’t think you can. Sloane 
You lack basic reading comprehension. I am half Croatian, half-Bosnian. I am Catholic, not Muslim LOL. You have mental issues. Attila 
Muslim sympathizer on your Bosnian Muslim side is enough for me. That explains why you are in the same hate camp with the libshits. Good combo! Since you are talking about mental issues please take your medication and do yourself a favor and don’t skip again! Sloane 
What Bosnian Muslim side and hate camp? Do you even understand English? Do you know ANYTHING? Read my comments again. I am 100% Catholic. I told you to read up on history books, you are trying to defend Eastern European history when you don’t even know it. Croatia is 90% Catholic, Bosnia is Muslim, Orthodox and Catholic. I am half Bosnian Croat half Croat Catholic, so 100% Catholic. You retard. We in Dubrovnik remained independent and will continue to remain independent so we don’t have to fear the muslims like you do. The ones that are the most foreign, like you Asiatic Hungarians, are the ones most afraid of immigrants and are full of complexes as your messages have show. Goodbye now bozgor. Attila 
Still trying the fool me. Christian Croats live in Herzegovina and not the Bosnian side. Nice but a stupid try. It may have worked with someone else. I like your way of using the word Bozgor because it fits you. Really expresses your true intention and bigotry. I guess I should thank you for that. You know it’s not a bad thing to fear Muslims when they slaved and killed us and turned the country in to a wasteland just because we were Christians. I guess it does something to the psyche. Say hello to you Muslims neighbors and friends in Bosnia aIm sure you enjoy your time with them. John L. Wildman 
I agree. The more Atilla talks, the more stupid he sounds. Scooter McHeadshot 
Trying to include the US as a primary culprit shows your lack of knowledge and history. The US was at best a 3d string team when it came to colonies and military adventurism overseas. The ENTIRE problem of the middle east and africa can be lain squarely at the feet of the europeans, most notably the English and French, with honorable mention to the Germans, Dutch and Portuguese (and in the 20th century the Soviets) If you really think the Ottomans were 1.) holding arabia together and 2.) kept it peaceful, you have some reading to do. The Ottomans were barely hanging on the last 300 years of their reign, and fought against countless rebellions and foreign invasions due to the nature of their “empire”. Try reading “A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Turkish Empire and the Making of the Modern Middle East” by David Fromkin. Also read “The Arabs” by Eugene Rogan, it has a decent overview of the problems and shortcomings of the Ottomans. Diesel67 
The Ottomans lost their empire because they backed the wrong horse in World War I and because of local disgust with their corrupt misrule. Their fault. BTW, the Arabs and other Muslims they ruled over were not Turks and did not speak Turkish. Arutima 
10 millions? That’s cute. The British have beaten that just with the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Where they used musket balls covered with pork tallow and fat, and buried Mughal Muslim troops alive with pork carcasses. Steve Haden

The reason this is forgotten is because it happened in the 1800s, with no radio, not a lot of press even, and certainly no cinema. The Congolese that survived probably mostly stayed in Congo. They were also black, so few white people at the time cared (they should, but in the 1800s didn’t) and few other people knew (they should but in the 1800s didn’t). 
The Holocaust in Europe happened to a very educated people (not judging, just stating a fact) of the which most survivers migrated to Israel and North America which means they talked and talked about it but not just among themselves but on radio in the USA, on movies like Schindler’s List and set museums not in Congo but in New York and established a state called Israel that made it a policy to spread awareness of the Holocaust. The Jews are also a people that are central to world affairs and always have been – again, just stating a fact without judgement (that’s true in science, politics, and many other areas). 
Therefore it’s not just an arbitrary or a racist fact, but the differences in both tragedies, that made the Congolese genocide (and many others) be forgotten and the one perpetrated to the Jews remembered. 
Compare that to Darfour, in the 2000s and yes, a lot more people know and have heard of such a genocide. So it is not just race, it is also time and place that determined memorability. Arron Frazier 
Your comment about whites calling themselves Jews being educated is attempted back hand slap at African people being unintelligent which is typical propaganda of white supremacist. First of the so-called Holocaust was plain and simple white on white crime and violence. The whites of Europe WW2 and back to the start of the Catholic Church committed alot crime violence and killing against each. It was constant warring disputes and etc. They where always trying to rule over each other or trying to rule of thew world know at that time. African people had nothing to do with that at all. Second the Congo and Africa have been the economic engine of western civilization since the 1400’s with slavery colonialism imperalism and now Neo-colonialism. Third your notion whites calling themselves Jews are and have always been central to world affairs is a lie. They are central today because of white supremacy leaving Europe in the 1400’s with slavery colonialism and imperailism. Whites calling themselves Jews where right in the middle of everything and in many cases controlling and leading things. Prior to that whites calling themselves Jews have been central to the affairs of empires civilization and peoples of the America’s Africa and Asia. They had nothing to do with the Aztec Incas Olmecs Mayans and varies tribes and nations of North America. They had nothing to do with Africa with ancient Egypt Nubia Ethopia Great Zimbabwe Congo empires Ashanti Zulus Nok and etc. They had nothing to do with Asia with the Chinese dynasties civilization empire nor the Japanese India Anka Wat and etc. What happen in Europe was nothing more than white or white crime which was common practice among whites WW2 going back over a 1000 years. Naten Vos 
But this genocide was not forgotten at the time itself. English journalists documented this genocide at the time which forced Leopold II to sell his colony to Belgium. So it’s not true that there was no press and no information. Of course it is true that information was much more limited than now or than information of Europe during WOII. It is ‘forgotten’ or less known now maybe because our interest is fading. And that is a sad thing. Btw: David Van Reybrouck wrote a history on Congo. Interesting read, also available in english. sabelmouse 
the holocaust had films, photos, super documentation. would that we had the same regarding colonial misdeeds, slave ships, and plantations. maybe people would pay more attention. i do often link pics from india during the late victorian holocausts, people being starved, and worked to death by the british empire. junktex

The first few paragraphs do little more than harangue the reader and our educational system for not being familiar with an obscure king of a tiny European country more than a century ago who did horrible things in one of the most remote and impoverished parts of Africa. This is despite the fact that of the hundreds of nations that have existed in this world, many have done truly horrible things, but our educational system can barely cover our own country, with little mention beyond about a half-dozen others. Just how broad and deep do you think our educational system ought to cover world and human events? Speaking of which, what was the Ottoman Empire doing at the same time as this king? Irina Godunko

Kimmel railed against lawmakers who  won t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip,  insisting that their  thoughts and your prayers are insufficient. The comic responded to those saying there was nothing that could have been done to stop Sunday s attack.  I disagree with that intensely,  Kimmel said,  because of course there s something we can do about it.

56051,"The Politics of Death: Cancer and Politics, a personal story","License DMCA This is not about how politics controls research on cancer and other diseases. It is about a political economy which, in the name of democracy, is killing us.
Today, I got my PSA score (used to assess degree of cancer), and it was not down, after 4 months of a heavy duty cannabis extract treatment and numerous anti-cancer supplements, along with a vegan anti-cancer diet. It didn't go down. After my cancerous prostate was removed 10 years, ago I had nearly 8 yrs cancer free, then two years, ago the score began to rise, from .2 to .4. to .5 to today's .6. 
That is a low score, but it is growing and my treatments have not stopped it. I ask: how can I have got cancer when since age 26, I have been on an organic anti-cancer diet? 
There are two theories, not necessarily incompatible: one asserts, as the man who discovered the cause of cancer did, that the cause is pollution. Dr. Warburg won the Nobel Prize but the Nazis kept him from accepting it. He said pollution caused cancer. 
The other theory is the genetic element: studies on twins seem to show that there is a genetic component, which may not cause cancer but predispose to it, make us vulnerable to the onslaught of pollution. 
So I am going to go with the idea that tho genetics makes some more susceptible, it is pollution which is killing us. 
On a gross level, this is easy to see. Each year, millions die from fossil fuel pollution; in the US, 13,000 die from coal pollution, and tens of millions suffer from air pollution, not to mention water pollution as in Flint, Michagan and many other cities. - Advertisement - 
Why do we have so much pollution? Why haven't we switched to clean energy? Why haven't we banned fossil fuels, which are poisons we eat and drink and breath every day? 
We know that pollution kills, makes sick, decreases productivity, increases healthcare costs, makes us suffer and destroys the environment, including climate disruption? Why is nothing being done? 
The reason is simple: politics. The oligarchy is made up of those who profit from pollution, from the energy industry to the ag industry. In a democracy, these corporations which are killing us would be stopped. 
But in an oligarchy where the polluters rule, all action is to prevent action; private profits trump public safety. Money trumps human health. Accumulating billions is more important than protecting the earth. This is a political decision, within a system of oligarchic rule. We are being killed by cancer because the ruling class has hijacked government and made effective regulation impossible. We are being killed by design, since the fossil fuel elites know the damage their products do. 
And so, as I ponder my next treatment (probably immunotherapy), I ask everyone to consider how our politics, mostly right wing, Republican, pro-corporate but including the establishment Democrats. Clinton, for instance, has received 7 million from the fossil fuel people this year. Clinton is also on record of supporting fracking. - Advertisement - 
Here is what Sanders said of her in April: """"Well, when you vote for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs, when you support and continue to support fracking, despite the crisis that we have in terms of clean water,"" he said April 10, ""and essentially, when you have a super PAC that is raising tens of millions of dollars from every special interest out there, including $15 million from Wall Street, the American people do not believe that that is the kind of president that we need to make the changes in America to protect the working families of this country."" 
Politifact concludes that ""Clinton's past support of fracking is well documented."" 
And so it is not only the Republican's who are blocking action to reduce the damage done by fossil fuels; it is also the Democrats, who are bribed with millions to continue the status quo. Now Clinton says she wants solar on every roof. That is easy to say, and it will get some Bernie supporters to accept her. But her history is of defending the fossil fuel industry. And history trumps hypotheticals. Early detection means early treatment License DMCA Conclusion: pollution is killing us. Both parties have protected this lethal industry to varying degrees. It seems, as with so much else, that if we want change, if we want to stop killing ourselves with toxins in our air and food and water, we will have to finally end the rule of the oligarchs and establish a democratic nation, where the leaders lead in ending pollution and transforming us to clean energy and with it, better health for our families and our earth.",1

Getting antioxidants from teas will prevent damage of cells, and lower risk of cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Use the herbal teas below to get enough antioxidants. 
1. Echinacea Tea 
This tea will boost your immune system. A study conducted on people with early signs of cold and flu found that there was faster recovery in those who drank tea with Echinacea, compared to those who didn’t. Studies also show that this herbal tea reduces risk of colds by 58 percent. 
2. Matcha Green Tea 
Green tea is among the most consumed herbal teas in the world. But matcha green tea (from japan) is the healthiest. It has 17 times more antioxidants than blueberries. 
3. Fennel tea 
Fennel tea can reduce bloating and gas. Research also shows that it can even reduce menstrual pain. 
4. Lavender tea 
This herb can keep you calm and reduce anxiety. It can also treat insomnia, arthritis, body aches, and stomach problems. 
5. Chamomile Tea 
This herb is popularly known for increasing calmness and improving quality of sleep. But it can also regulate blood sugar levels , and consequently lower risk of diabetes. In this study researchers found that chamomile lowered mortality risk by 29 percent. 
6. Lemongrass Tea 
This tea can lower blood pressure, aid digestion, and reduce anxiety. It also has antibacterial and antifungal properties that will improve skin health and reduce risk of developing colds and flus. 
7. Nettle tea 
This tea will get rid of toxins in the urinary tract. Additionally, nettle is rich in iron which means it will reduce risk of anemia. 
8. Hibiscus tea 
Researchers say that hibiscus tea can lower blood pressure and reduce pain in the respiratory tract. 
9. Oolong tea 
This tea is made using the same plants used to make black or green teas. But it ages at a duration longer than green tea but shorter than black tea. Studies show it can enhance weight loss and lower cholesterol. 
10. Thyme tea 
Thyme tea is rich in antioxidants which reduce pain in the stomach and throat. In fact, it’s an excellent pain reliever for most body aches. 
11. Rooibos tea 
Rooibos can eliminate allergies, asthma and high blood pressure. You can greatly benefit from drinking 2-3 cups a day. 
12. Peppermint tea 
Researchers say that this tea can improve digestion. It has also been said to increase satiety and promote weight loss. 
13. Rosemary tea 
According to research , rosemary can boost brain performance. And it can also improve eye health.

In one clip, an object can be seen flying through the sky as bystanders stand in shock. 
This isn’t the first time a flying object has created such hype in Austria. During the 2016 New Year festivities, another UFO was spotted reportedly being hit by lightning in Lower Austria. For now, though, “the truth is out there.” From Around the Web Founder of WorldTruth.Tv and WomansVibe.com Eddie ( 8922 Posts )

30377,TRUMP BEGINS DISMANTLING Of OBAMACARE With Today’s Executive Order…Nancy Pelosi’s Response Is Hilarious!,"Today, President Trump came one step closer to dismantling Obamacare. He signed an executive order that would allow Americans to purchase insurance across state lines. The time has come to take action to IMPROVE access, INCREASE choices, and LOWER COSTS for HEALTHCARE!  https://t.co/mz5fdveTVh pic.twitter.com/dDZLsKuNSe  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2017Congressional Democrats said Thursday that President Trump s executive order to relax insurance rules is the latest evidence of Republican  sabotage  against Obamacare.The president signed the order that directs federal agencies to examine regulations that would make it easier for people to band together to get  association health plans  and buy more short-term insurance. Democrats quickly criticized the order as a back door to attack protections for people with pre-existing conditions and increase  junk  insurance plans.
