40597,"COWARDLY CHAIN MIGRATION TERRORIST Who Entered US During Obama’s Second Term, Mocked President Trump Just Before Failing To Blow Himself Up","Yesterday, a cowardly recipient of America s generosity, via a broken chain migration policy, walked through the busy subway terminal near the Port Authority Transit hub, where he planned to use a homemade bomb strapped to his body as a weapon to  terrorize as many people as possible.  The chain migration terrorist claims he chose the Port Authority site because the poor little radicalized Muslim who America welcomed with open arms, was triggered by the Christmas posters that hung in the hallways of the terminal. The chain migration terrorist, who was inspired by ISIS, failed miserably.The media will show their true colors when they ignore the ease with which radical Muslims from hotbed terror nations have been allowed to enter the United States, and will instead, will focus on Ullah s statement about wanting to punish President Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The media will also ignore the fact that we wouldn t even be having this conversation if Ullah was not allowed to enter the United States during Obama s presidency. It was actually during Barack Hussein Obama s second term in 2014, that Ullah began to explore ways to commit acts of terror against Americans, as a way to show his allegiance to the cowardly terror group, ISIS. (See paragraph  f. )Port Authority bomber Akayed Ullah wanted to send a message straight to the White House:  Trump you failed to protect your nation. Here is a screenshot of the complaint filed by Assistant United States Attorneys:That s what the 27-year-old ISIS adherent wrote on his Facebook page while on his way to blow himself up at the bustling transit hub Monday morning, according to the federal complaint filed Tuesday.He had also written in his passport:  O AMERICA, DIE IN YOUR RAGE. The charges also reveal that the 27-year-old Bangeldesh-born cabbie s online radicalization began in 2014, and he began researching how to build bombs a year ago   although he only constructed his crude explosive device at his Brooklyn home a week ago.Ullah built the bomb for  maximum damage,  federal prosecutors charge   filling it with metal screws   and performed the bombing on a workday because  he believed that there would be more people.

43374,"German, Turkish foreign ministers meet after detainee released","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s foreign minister Siegmar Gabriel met his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu in Turkey on Saturday, in a chance to discuss strained ties between the NATO allies after a series of diplomatic incidents. Gabriel and Cavusoglu discussed  bilateral relationships as well as difficult themes and expectations on both sides  in an informal meeting in the Turkish city of Antalya, the German foreign ministry said on Twitter, without giving further detail.    The meeting came a day after the announcement of the release of a further German national who had been detained in Turkey for political reasons, leaving the tally of those still in jail at nine.  Ties between the two allies deteriorated after Turkish President Recep Erdogan launched a crackdown on political opponents after a failed coup last year. Germany has criticized the mass arrests and refused to extradite people Turkey says were involved in the plot. Relations with Turkey are a contentious issue in talks on forming a coalition government that Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservative bloc is holding with two other parties after she lost support in an election in September.

39516,Yellen Sees Stronger Case for Interest Rate Increase - The New York Times,"GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo.  —   Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Friday that she saw a stronger case for raising the Fed’s benchmark interest rate, suggesting the central bank was likely to act in the coming months. “In light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months,” Ms. Yellen said. The remarks, delivered at an annual policy conference here, indicated that the Fed would consider raising rates at its next meeting in   though most analysts say they think the central bank is more likely to move in December. In trading on Friday, the chances of a September increase rose to 36 percent from 21 percent, according to a measure derived from asset prices. The chances of a rate increase by the end of the year rose to 61 percent from 52 percent. Stanley Fischer, the Fed’s vice chairman, who has suggested in recent months that the economy is strong enough to move, told the cable business network CNBC that a strong August employment report, due Sept. 2, “would probably weigh in our decision. ” But some officials remain nervous about the fragility of this long but tepid period of economic growth. The Fed also may be inclined to wait until after the presidential election in November, like earlier this year, when Fed officials said they did not want to raise rates before Britain’s referendum on European Union membership in June. Ms. Yellen’s speech “leaves the Fed in a stance of watchful waiting, which is exactly where it was at the end of the last F. O. M. C. meeting in July,” Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC, wrote in an analysis. “Policy makers are leaning toward a rate hike, but feel that they can wait until they are more confident that the expansion will continue at a sustainable pace. ” The Fed raised interest rates in December for the first time since the financial crisis and predicted four more rate increases this year. Instead, it has kept its benchmark rate between 0. 25 and 0. 5 percent. Low rates encourage borrowing and   which can bolster economic growth. Raising rates will gradually reduce that stimulus, and the Fed has been reluctant so far to take its foot off the gas. Ms. Yellen’s remarks appeared aimed in part at jarring the complacency of investors who had concluded that the Fed would not raise rates in September. Fed officials have repeatedly warned that markets had too much confidence in the likely path of policy, given the central bank’s considerable uncertainty about its own plans. Ms. Yellen underscored the point with a chart showing that Fed officials thought rates could plausibly end 2017 anywhere from nearly zero to 4 percent. Yet she also stopped short of echoing other Fed officials who have suggested in recent weeks that they are inclined to raise rates in September. The Fed’s   committee is scheduled to meet Sept. 20 and 21 in Washington. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said last week in Anchorage that a rate increase “makes good sense. ” He repeated that point Thursday during an unusual meeting attended by 10 Fed policy makers and more than 100 activists brought to Jackson Hole by the Fed Up campaign, a coalition of community and labor groups pressing the central bank to postpone rate hikes. “It’s not about trying to stop the economy from growing,” Mr. Williams said, explaining his view that the economy no longer required quite as much help from the Fed. “We’re going to keep this economy growing we are going to run it hot. ” Yasenia Castro, a protester from Brooklyn, said at a demonstration before the meeting that she had not been able to find a   job since 2013. Ms. Castro, 35, has an associate degree in criminal justice and works weekends as a babysitter she and her three children live with her mother to make ends meet. “If you’re a Fed official, and you think the economy has recovered, tell me why I’m still working as a babysitter when I have a degree,” Ms. Castro said. Fed officials said repeatedly that they sympathized with the protesters, but they added that pushing too hard to increase employment could be counterproductive if it led to a recession. Those struggling now would likely suffer most. “Everybody on this panel is painfully aware of what the costs of the last recession were and wants to avoid a future recession,” Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said during the Thursday meeting. Much of Ms. Yellen’s speech on Friday was devoted to the question of whether the central bank will be ready when the next recession inevitably comes. Even as the Fed moves to continue raising rates, officials expect that they will not rise nearly as much in the coming years as they did during previous periods of economic growth. That means the Fed will not be able to match the scale of the rate cuts it used to combat previous downturns. But Ms. Yellen said that the Fed in recent years had shown that other kinds of stimulus could also be effective. After cutting its benchmark rate to nearly zero, the Fed amplified the effect by promising to keep rates low. It also bought trillions of dollars in Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, forcing investors to accept lower interest rates. “Even if average interest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively,” Ms. Yellen said. She cited a recent analysis by David Reifschneider, a Fed economist, that found that the central bank’s new set of tools would most likely be sufficient to compensate for the weakening of its traditional tool of lowering   interest rates. Ms. Yellen added that the Fed was “not actively considering” a range of other possible policy responses to a future crisis. These include buying assets other than Treasury securities, like municipal bonds, or raising the Fed’s inflation target above 2 percent. She also noted that fiscal policy makers could play a role in addressing any future crises. In particular, she said, the government should consider policies that might increase the productivity of the American work force. “Finally, and most ambitiously, as a society we should explore ways to raise productivity growth,” Ms. Yellen said. Among the possibilities, she mentioned investment in education and infrastructure and reductions in regulation.",0
64901,'Suicidal' Danish submarine owner says journalist killed by hatch cover,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Swedish journalist Kim Wall died when she was accidentally hit by a heavy hatch cover on board a home-made submarine, the Danish owner of the vessel testified in court on Tuesday. Peter Madsen, who denies killing Wall, said he was holding the hatch for her but it slipped and hit her head as they sailed in the strait between Denmark and Sweden last month on the UC3 Nautilus submarine he had built.  Madsen, 46, was speaking in court after being charged with killing the Swedish journalist on the submarine and mutilating her body   a case bearing many of the attributes of the region s popular Nordic Noir books and films. It could mean a sentence of five years to life in prison for Madsen, if found guilty. The court on Tuesday ordered a psychiatric evaluation and that Madsen be kept in custody for four weeks. In its preliminary investigation, the court had ordered Madsen detained until Tuesday on the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter. Madsen said Wall s death was an accident. With the vessel at the surface, he said he had crawled out through the hatch and was standing on top, while holding it open  to let Wall follow him. At that moment, the submarine was rocked by a wave from another boat.  I lose my foothold and the hatch shuts,  he told the Copenhagen court, saying Wall was knocked to the floor.  There was a pool of blood where she had landed.  A prosecutor also read earlier testimony from behind closed doors in which Madsen said the impact had fractured the journalist s skull and killed her. Madsen said he tried to bury her at sea but denied mutilating her body, and added that he had contemplated killing himself while still on board. Wall, a 30-year-old freelance journalist who was researching a story on Madsen, went missing after he took her out to sea in his 17-metre (56-foot) submarine on Aug. 10. On Aug. 23, police identified a headless female torso that washed ashore in Copenhagen as Wall s. The cause of her death has not been determined. In court, Madsen denied having amputated her limbs and said he dropped her  whole  body into the water, several hours after her death, after having a sleep because he was  tired and exhausted . He admitted that he wanted to  bury her at sea  by attaching metal to the body in order for it to sink.   I had no contact with the body and didn t want a dead body in my submarine,  Madsen told the court.  I put a rope around her feet to drag her out of the hatch,  he said, adding that he was crying during this operation.  I am suicidal at this stage (and) thought a fitting end for Peter Madsen would be on board the Nautilus,  he said.  I was in a condition where I decided I couldn t continue the life I had been living.  He changed his mind, he said, because he wanted to see his wife and three cats. The submarine is one of three Madsen had built and one of the largest privately built ones in the world. It could carry eight people and weighed 40 tonnes fully equipped. A day after taking Wall out to sea, Madsen was rescued in a navy operation after deliberately sinking the vessel. ",0
49683,Colony NorthStar ends consulting agreement with former Trump aide Gates,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Colony NorthStar Inc has ended a consulting agreement with Rick Gates, a former campaign aide to U.S. President Donald Trump, a spokesman for the real estate and financial firm said on Monday. Gates, who had been working as a consultant for Colony for six months, according to the spokesman, was indicted on Monday on charges of conspiracy to launder money and failing to report foreign bank accounts to the U.S. government.  The charges were part of a probe by Robert Mueller, a special counsel appointed to investigate whether Russia tried  to tilt the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favor, and whether members of the Trump campaign colluded in any such effort.  Gates pleaded not guilty to all charges on Monday. David Bos, the lawyer who represented Gates in an appearance in federal court, declined to comment. Gates could not be reached for comment. A longtime associate of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was also indicted on Monday, Gates continued to work on Trump’s campaign after Manafort left in August 2016. Gates also worked with Colony NorthStar founder and executive chairman Thomas Barrack Jr. on Trump’s presidential inaugural committee, according to three sources who asked not to be identified. Barrack chaired the committee. ",0
55065,1 World Trade Center Gains Popularity in the Pantheon of New York Kitsch - The New York Times,"You glance toward Lower Manhattan and expect to see a single tower where two once stood. You delight in the spectacle of sunlight glinting off its slivered facade. Suddenly, you realize, the new 1 World Trade Center  —   the Freedom Tower  —   has become familiar. And 15 years after the twin towers disappeared abruptly from the skyline, they have begun to fade from popular consciousness. They once nearly rivaled the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building as simple, graphic representations of the complex idea of New York. In movies and logotypes, on knickknacks and letterheads, two parallel strokes meant only one thing. Now, a shaft of slender, alternating isosceles triangles  —   so simple a child could draw it  —   is coming to mean the same thing. Campagna  Sons of Brooklyn, which makes boxes for pizzerias around Lower Manhattan and nearby New Jersey cities like Hoboken and Weehawken, carries a Freedom Tower design, in         and   sizes. Instagram currently counts nearly 200, 000 posts tagged #oneworldtradecenter. Fishs Eddy, an imaginative housewares store in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan, has introduced the new 1 World Trade Center to its popular “212” line. But dinner plates and other “212” merchandise designed before Sept. 11, 2001, will still have the twin towers in the silhouetted skyline, Julie Gaines, an owner, said. The twin towers have not vanished from the insignia of the New York Fire Department. But last year, on the department’s 150th anniversary, they gave way temporarily to a commemorative patch designed by Firefighter Richard Miranda, of Rescue Company 1, showing the new 1 World Trade Center. The pizza box was designed by Joseph Campagna, who runs the business begun by his grandfather and carried on by his father and uncle. He was inspired to draw up a patriotic tableau with an oversize American flag flying over the new tower. The Campagnas can see the building from their headquarters on the waterfront in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. “It got bad for a while,” Mr. Campagna said. “But seeing the new tower being built was like seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. ” The design is so popular, he said, that some pizzerias refuse anything else. “If I run out of boxes and send them my stock design  —   Italian village  —   they’ll say, ‘I don’t want it,’” he said. “It’s been a smash hit. ” And not just at pizzerias. Using Times Square tchotchke shops as a barometer, the    tower is already nearing the apotheosis of kitsch. Though the Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building have nothing to fear yet, the Chrysler Building and Brooklyn Bridge may want to look to their laurels. The Freedom Tower is gaining fast. You can now buy snow globes with the tower. Or paperweights. Spoon rests. Key chains. Flasks. Compacts. Shot glasses. Or sheer, provocatively cut panties known as cheekies. “I’ve got this big smile on my face as you talk about souvenir shops,” said T. J. Gottesdiener, managing partner of Skidmore, Owings  Merrill, which designed 1 World Trade Center. (David M. Childs was the lead architect.) “‘Icon’ is the right word, but some of the reproductions are so grotesquely misproportioned that it’s very funny. ” Who controls such depictions? From a legal standpoint, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which developed the building in partnership with the Durst Organization. The authority has applied for trademark No. 86931748 on “the depiction of a building with a spire on top,” including its elongated triangular facets. In theory, the authority’s permission would have to be obtained to use this mark on hundreds of items that are listed on the trademark application, including, but not limited to, basting brushes, dust ruffles, mud flaps, fanny packs, mouse pads, rompers,   ornaments and golf divot repair tools. But there is no practical way to police such depictions. Two years ago, the agency tried to crack down on Fishs Eddy, saying the use of the twin tower silhouettes on its ceramic ware “interferes with the Port Authority’s control of its own reputation. ” John Oliver responded wickedly on the show “Last Week Tonight” by introducing a Port Authority Bus Terminal dinner plate, with silhouettes of a woman vomiting in a garbage can, a man urinating in a water fountain, a condom and a rat orgy. The authority dropped the matter. Ms. Gaines said, “They would have to sue every souvenir shop in the city, not just us. ” “Our position is consistent,” she added, “that we don’t believe anyone owns the silhouette of the New York City skyline. ” Put another way, everyone owns it. “One World Trade Center and every other structure on the site hold our impossible wish: to have back everyone who was lost on Sept. 11,” Judith Dupré wrote in “One World Trade Center: Biography of the Building. ” “Of all the challenges that the World Trade Center has had to face, perhaps the biggest one is exorcising the ghosts of the structures that it replaced. ”",0
37393,Donald Trump’s Victory Promises to Upend the International Order - The New York Times,"JERUSALEM  —   Donald J. Trump’s stunning election victory on Tuesday night rippled way beyond the nation’s boundaries, upending an international order that prevailed for decades and raising profound questions about America’s place in the world. For the first time since before World War II, Americans chose a president who promised to reverse the internationalism practiced by predecessors of both parties and to build walls both physical and metaphorical. Mr. Trump’s win foreshadowed an America more focused on its own affairs while leaving the world to take care of itself. The outsider revolution that propelled him to power over the Washington establishment of both political parties also reflected a fundamental shift in international politics evidenced already this year by events like Britain’s referendum vote to leave the European Union. Mr. Trump’s success could fuel the populist, nativist, nationalist,   movements already so evident in Europe and spreading to other parts of the world. Global markets fell after Tuesday’s election and many around the world scrambled to figure out what it might mean in parochial terms. For Mexico, it seemed to presage a new era of confrontation with its northern neighbor. For Europe and Asia, it could rewrite the rules of modern alliances, trade deals, and foreign aid. For the Middle East, it foreshadowed a possible alignment with Russia and fresh conflict with Iran. “All bets are off,” said Agustín Barrios Gómez, a former congressman in Mexico and president of the Mexico Image Foundation, an organization dedicated to promoting its reputation abroad. Crispin Blunt, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in Britain’s House of Commons, said, “We are plunged into uncertainty and the unknown. ” Many linked Mr. Trump’s victory to the British vote to exit the European Union and saw a broader unraveling of the modern international system. “After Brexit and this election, everything is now possible,” Gérard Araud, the French ambassador to the United States, wrote on Twitter. “A world is collapsing before our eyes. ” The election enthralled people around the world on Tuesday night: night owls watching television in a youth hostel in Tel Aviv computer technicians monitoring results on their laptops in Hong Kong and even onetime oil pipeline terrorists in Nigeria’s remote Delta creeks, who expressed concern about how Mr. Trump’s election would affect their country. It is hardly surprising that much of the world was rooting for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump, who characterized his foreign policy as “America First. ” He promised to build a wall along the Mexican border and temporarily bar Muslim immigrants from entering the United States. He questioned Washington’s longstanding commitment to NATO allies, called for cutting foreign aid, praised President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, vowed to rip up international trade deals, assailed China and suggested Asian allies develop nuclear weapons. Polls indicated that Mrs. Clinton was favored in many countries, with the exception of Russia. Last summer, the Pew Research Center found that people in all 15 countries it surveyed trusted Mrs. Clinton to do the right thing in foreign affairs more than Mr. Trump by ratios as high as 10 to one. Mr. Trump’s promise to pull back militarily and economically left many overseas contemplating a road ahead without an American ally. “The question is whether you will continue to be involved in international affairs as a dependable ally to your friends and allies,” said Kunihiko Miyake, a former Japanese diplomat now teaching at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. “If you stop doing that, then all the European, Middle Eastern and Asian allies to the United States will reconsider how they secure themselves. ” In Germany, where American troops have been stationed for more than seven decades, the prospect of a pullback seemed bewildering. “It would be the end of an era,” Henrik Müller, a journalism professor at the Technical University of Dortmund, wrote in Der Spiegel. “The postwar era in which Americans’ atomic weapons and its military presence in Europe shielded first the west and later the central European states would be over. Europe would have to take care of its own security. ” Norbert Röttgen, chairman of the German parliamentary committee for foreign policy and a member of the ruling party, said Mr. Trump was “completely inadequate” to his office. “That Trump’s election could lead to the worst estrangement between America and Europe since the Vietnam War would be the least of the damage,” he said. Perhaps nowhere was Mr. Trump’s win more alarming than in Mexico, which has objected to his promises to build a wall and bill America’s southern neighbor for it. “I see a clear and present danger,” said Rossana   director of the Mexico Media Lab, a think tank, and a founder of the Latin American edition of Foreign Affairs. “Every moment will be a challenge. Every move or declaration will be something that will not make us comfortable in the neighborhood  —   and that is to everyone’s detriment. ” With about $531 billion in trade in goods last year, Mexico is America’s   partner after Canada and China. Supply chains in both countries are interdependent, with American goods and parts shipped to Mexican factories to build products that are shipped back into the United States for sale. Five million American jobs directly depend on trade with Mexico, according to the Mexico Institute. The Mexican peso immediately fell 13 percent after the election, its biggest drop in decades. Mr. Barrios Gómez, the former congressman, predicted a   peso devaluation of 20 percent and a Mexican recession “as supply chains across the continent become sclerotic and investments dry up. ” The business community, he said, was “freaking out. ” The economic fallout will probably reverberate farther. Izumi Kobayashi, vice chairwoman of Keizai Doyukai, a Japanese business group, predicted a drop in foreign investment in the United States as executives skeptical of Mr. Trump wait to see what he does. “He has been focusing on the negative side of the global markets and globalization,” Ms. Kobayashi said. “But at the same time it is really difficult to go back to the old business world. So how will he explain to the people that benefit and also the fact that there is no option to go back to the old model of business?” The uneasiness with Mr. Trump’s victory overseas ranged far beyond the country’s traditional partners. Abubakar Kari, a   professor at the University of Abuja, said most Nigerians believed a Trump administration would not bother with issues outside the United States. “If Trump wins, God forbid,” Macharia Gaitho, one of Kenya’s most popular columnists, wrote on Tuesday before the votes came in, “then we will have to reassess our relations with the United States. ” One of the few places where Mr. Trump’s victory was greeted enthusiastically was Russia, where   television has been feasting on the circuslike elements of the American election. Not since the Cold War has Russia played such a big role in a presidential election, with Mr. Trump praising Mr. Putin and American investigators concluding that Russians had hacked Democratic email messages. “Trump’s presidency will make the U. S. sink into a   crisis, including an economic one,” said Vladimir Frolov, a Russian columnist and international affairs analyst. “The U. S. will be occupied with its own issues and will not bother Putin with questions. ” “As a consequence,” he added, “Moscow will have a window of opportunity in geopolitical terms. For instance, it can claim control over the former Soviet Union and a part of the Middle East. What is there not to like?” Others tried to find the upside. Mr. Blunt, the British lawmaker, said he was heartened by Mr. Trump’s selection of Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana as his running mate and thought that Britain might be the exception to the new president’s hostility toward trade deals. Israel was another place where Mr. Trump enjoyed some support, mainly because of the perception that he would give the country a freer hand in its handling of the longstanding conflict with the Palestinians. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders and commentators worried about a broader disengagement from a Middle East awash in war, terrorism and upheaval. “Decisions cannot be postponed,” said Yohanan Plesner, a former member of the Israeli Parliament now serving as president of the Israel Democracy Institute. “The situation in Syria is very chaotic. The unrest in the region is continuing. America has to decide whether it wants to play an active role in shaping the developments of the region. ” And even some countries that might expect to see some benefits from an American retreat worried about the implications. Counterintuitive as it might seem, China was concerned about Mr. Trump’s promise to pull American troops back from Asia. “If he indeed withdraws the troops from Japan, the Japanese may develop their own nuclear weapons,” said Shen Dingli, professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai. “South Korea may also go nuclear if Trump cancels the missile deployment and leaves the country alone facing the North’s threats. How is that good for China?” For American voters, that was not the point. After decades of worrying about what was good for other countries, they decided it was time to worry about what was good for America. And Mr. Trump promised to do just that, even if the rest of the world might not like it.",0

29709,"Robert Silvers, a Founding Editor of New York Review of Books, Dies at 87 - The New York Times","Robert B. Silvers, a founder of The New York Review of Books, which under his editorship became one of the premier intellectual journals in the United States, a showcase for extended, thoughtful essays on literature and politics by eminent writers, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87. Rea S. Hederman, the publisher of The Review, confirmed the death. The New York Review, founded in 1963, was born with a mission  —   to raise the standards of book reviewing and literary discussion in the United States and nurture a hybrid form of   essay. Mr. Silvers brought to its pages a   almost priestly sense of devotion that ultimately made him indistinguishable from the publication he edited, and it from him. He shared editorial duties with Barbara Epstein until her death in 2006, but it was Mr. Silvers who came to embody The Review’s mystique, despite, or perhaps because of, his insistence on remaining a    presence, loath to grant interviews or make public appearances. “I put my name on the paper, and the rest I don’t care to be known,” he told Philip Nobile, the author of “Intellectual Skywriting: Literary Politics and The New York Review of Books” (1974). In a 2008 interview for the online program Thoughtcast, Mr. Silvers said: “The editor is a middleman. The one thing he should avoid is taking credit. It’s the writer that counts. ” He arrived at the office early and left late, if at all, to the kind of heavyweight cocktail party that was, for him, a happy hunting ground for writers and ideas. For many years, his companion was Grace, the Countess of Dudley, with whom he shared a passion for opera and a vacation home in Lausanne, Switzerland. She died in December. Mr. Silvers is survived by nieces and nephews. His myriad enthusiasms found their way into a publication that was edited for an audience of one. When asked to describe readers, he once said, “I really don’t know too much about them. ” He was happiest surrounded by stacks of manuscripts by the writers he pursued with flattery and guile in one typical instance, he drafted Jonathan Miller to write about John Updike’s novel “The Centaur” for the first issue of The Review by waylaying him after a performance of “Beyond the Fringe” on Broadway. He would inundate them with newspaper clippings, afterthoughts, helpful notes and suggestions for further reading as they toiled over their assignments. It was routine for him to hunt down contributors on their vacations. The   phone call was not unknown. Most writers regarded him with admiration verging on awe. “He was one of those rare editors who is also one’s ideal reader,” Ian Buruma, a marquee writer for The Review since 1985, said in a phone interview for this obituary in 2011. “He was not only sympathetic, but you knew that he would get it, and not try to rewrite because he really wanted to be a writer. He was unusual in being interested in so many things, in a profound way  —   a polymath who knew a tremendous amount about many subjects. ” Robert Benjamin Silvers was born on Dec. 31, 1929, in Mineola, N. Y. a village on Long Island. His father, James, was a businessman who left Manhattan to live the rural life. His mother, the former Rose Roden, was the music critic for the The New York Globe, long since disappeared. A precocious student, he left high school in Rockville Centre at 15 and enrolled in the University of Chicago. He pursued an accelerated   program, earning a bachelor’s degree in 1947. Mr. Silvers spent three semesters studying law, without enthusiasm, at Yale. In 1950, he entered the Army and was assigned to the intelligence library of NATO military headquarters in Paris. He studied at the Sorbonne and Sciences Po. After completing his military service, he remained in Paris, living on a houseboat on the Seine with the future bandleader Peter Duchin. He patched together a living as a representative of the publisher Noonday Press and an editor of a quarterly magazine published by the World Assembly of Youth the magazine, probably unknown to him, was financed by the C. I. A. An introduction to George Plimpton led to a post as managing editor of the newly created Paris Review, a journal in some disarray and badly in need of an editorial guiding hand. “It seemed to me quite a natural thing,” Mr. Silvers told The Guardian of his decision to take up editing as a vocation. “It was something I could do without even making a choice. ” Interviewed by Mr. Nobile for his book, Mr. Plimpton said of Mr. Silvers: “He was rather shy but formidable, and a strong voice amidst all this sturm und drang. He made The Paris Review what it was. ” John Fischer, the editor of Harper’s, hired Mr. Silvers at the recommendation of Mr. Plimpton’s father, Francis, a corporate lawyer, to oversee literary articles and book reviews at the magazine in 1958. In that job, Mr. Silvers became known for bringing in new writers like Elizabeth Hardwick, Mary McCarthy, Kingsley Amis and Alfred Kazin, and for orchestrating theme issues. Most notable was one titled “Writing in America,” published in October 1959 and later issued as a book, with an essay by Mr. Silvers from which he removed his byline. For that issue, he commissioned Ms. Hardwick, a literary critic, to write an extended essay on the state of book reviewing in the United States. She dismissed the reviewing in American newspapers and magazines as tepid, perfunctory, shallow and, in a word, noncritical. Her main target was The New York Times Book Review. Three years later, a typographers’ strike shut down nine major newspapers in New York. The timing was perfect. Jason Epstein, an editor at Random House, and his wife, Ms. Epstein, a freelance editor, had proposed the idea of a new publication in discussions with Ms. Hardwick and her husband, the poet Robert Lowell. They had in mind a literary review on the model of The Times Literary Supplement in London, or the literary section of the British magazine The New Statesman under V. S. Pritchett: a forum for writers to discuss ideas, books, ideas and politics at length, provocatively. When the newspaper strike deprived book publishers of their main advertising outlets, the pipe dream took on solid form, and Mr. Epstein immediately called Mr. Silvers, who had been thinking along similar lines, to engage him as an editor. Gathering in the offices of Harper’s at night, Mr. Silvers and his   worked their way through stacks of review books and compiled a list of ideal reviewers. When a trial issue of The Review was published in Feb. 1, 1963, many of those names were in its pages, writing free of charge: Mr. Kazin, Ms. McCarthy, Mr. Miller, Norman Mailer, Dwight Macdonald, Irving Howe, Gore Vidal, Susan Sontag, William Styron. The print run of 100, 000 sold out. In an astonishingly short time, The Review had not only turned a profit, but also established itself as a rival to two other magazines, Partisan Review and Commentary, an American counterpart founded in 1945. But unlike them, it made its starting point the world of books and publishing. Mr. Silvers liked essays that both made an argument and settled it. “We like important questions to be dealt with by experts with strong views,” he told Time magazine in 1967. He also liked to let writers roam, figuratively and literally, freed from the constraints imposed by most American publications. “What we saw was that the book review is a form that is capable of being used to address nearly any kind of issue, and any kind of question, because there’s always a book,” Mr. Silvers said in an interview at the University of California, Berkeley, Graduate School of Journalism in 1999. “Book reviewing can be a way of bringing critical perspectives to bear on the most intense political issues. ” Over the years, The Review became famous for   essays that often dealt only glancingly with the multiple book titles, sometimes as many as a dozen, nominally under consideration. Mr. Silvers liked to match writers with unexpected subjects. After noticing that Mr. Mailer had left Ms. McCarthy out of the discussion when he assessed “the talent in the room” in “Advertisements for Myself,” he assigned Mr. Mailer to review Ms. McCarthy’s novel “The Group. ” Applying the same logic to political writing, he sent Ms. McCarthy to Hanoi, Vietnam, and a reluctant V. S. Naipaul to the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas. When Joan Didion and her husband, John Gregory Dunne, traveled to El Salvador in 1982, Mr. Silvers coaxed a series of long dispatches from her on the difficult situation of a country in the grip of a   dictatorship. It later became a   book, “Salvador. ” The editing process was a characteristic performance by Mr. Silvers. “How Bob edited ‘Salvador’ was by constantly nudging me toward updates on the situation and by pointing out weaker material,” Ms. Didion told The Paris Review in 2006. “When I gave him the text, for example, it had a very weak ending, which was about meeting an American evangelical student on the flight home. In other words, it was the travel piece carried to its logical and not very interesting conclusion. “The way Bob led me away from this was to suggest not that I cut it (it’s still there) but that I follow it  —   and so ground it  —   with a return to the political situation. ” With Ms. Epstein as his   and A. Whitney Ellsworth as publisher, Mr. Silvers kept The Review in the thick of literary and political debate in the 1960s. He published searching critiques of American policy in Southeast Asia throughout the 1960s, featuring the work of I. F. Stone and Noam Chomsky prominently. The journal flirted with the New Left and became a byword for radical chic. The issue of Aug. 24, 1967, epitomized its political stance. The   journalist Andrew Kopkind wrote a scathing review of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ’s book “Where Do We Go From Here? Chaos or Community? ,” dismissing its author as hopelessly out of touch and accommodationist, while Tom Hayden contributed an analysis of the race riots in Newark that was accompanied by a diagram on how to make a Molotov cocktail. With the windup of the Vietnam War, Mr. Silvers opened up the pages of The Review to a host of British writers like Frank Kermode, A. Alvarez, Isaiah Berlin, A. J. P. Taylor and Christopher Ricks, who lent the magazine a more sedate literary tone, which made it seem less a successor to the brawling political journals that dominated New York intellectual life in the 1930s and 1940s than to majestic Victorian flagships like The Edinburgh Review. Politics never faded entirely from the picture. From the outset, Mr. Silvers made human rights and the need to check excessive state power his preoccupations, rising at times to the level of a crusade. Petitions and essays on behalf of political prisoners and victims of human rights violations were a constant feature. “I don’t like accepting anything as having its own necessary authority,” he told The Guardian in 2004. “That includes skepticism about government, which is a crucial point of view we have had from the first. ” Mr. Silvers, despite the magician’s aura and the seemingly sacred status of The Review, came in for his share of criticism. He seemed to have little interest in younger writers and, particularly in the 1970s, The Review seemed to suffer from an advanced case of Anglophilia. Despite its   as an arena of intellectual combat, it could be staid, even boring. The same writers showed up in issue after issue, and for a time, The Review was jokingly called The New York Review of Each Other’s Books. Mr. Silvers could blow hot and cold on his writers, courting them assiduously, then dropping them without explanation or apology. After the election of President George W. Bush and the advent of a more interventionist American foreign policy culminating in the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr. Silvers recast The Review as a leading critical voice. Recapturing its militant spirit of the 1960s, he filled its pages with long, scathing critiques of the government’s diplomacy, its conduct of the wars and its record on civil liberties. In a slightly astonished appreciation of the publication’s   Scott Sherman, in The Nation, praised “the   of The New York Review of Books as a powerful and combative actor on the political scene. ” For Mr. Silvers, The Review had never changed, only the circumstances of the world around it. Its personality and its mission had remained constant since the days of the newspaper strike. “I feel it is a fantastic opportunity  —   because of the freedom of it, because of the sense that there are marvelous, intensely interesting, important questions that you have a chance to try to deal with in an interesting way,” he told The New York Observer in 2005. “That’s an extraordinary opportunity in life. And you’d be crazy not to try and make the most of it. ”",0
25688,"U.N. watchdog tells Congo to hold election, clean up human rights","GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. Human Rights Committee on Thursday gave Democratic Republic of Congo a year to report on actions it has taken to hold free and fair elections and clean up its rights record. The United Nations watchdog, whose 18 independent experts monitor countries  compliance with a global human rights treaty, said Congo should come back with an explanation by Nov. 10, 2018, rather than after the regular four years between reviews. Congo should  cooperate with all stakeholders to establish an agreed electoral calendar for the holding of free, peaceful and honest elections as soon as possible , the committee said in its report on the central African country. Congo s electoral commission said on Sunday the election to replace President Joseph Kabila, originally scheduled for late 2016 and repeatedly delayed, would be held on Dec. 23, 2018. The main opposition parties have rejected the date, saying it broke the law and an agreement to go to the polls this year.  The African Union has said the new electoral timetable must be  scrupulously respected  and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has said citizens are  hungry for democracy and new leadership .  Further delays and attempts to hold onto power will only serve to isolate the DRC s leaders and government,  she said on Monday. The U.N. committee s report also said Kabila s government should put an end to intimidation and human rights violations against opposition candidates, and ensure they were protected.  The government should take steps to make judges, officials and the public aware of the rights guaranteed by the U.N. treaty, it said, listing shortcomings such as the treatment of women and indigenous minorities, torture, extrajudicial killings, child labor and arbitrary detention.  Sexual violence was persistent both in peaceful areas and in conflict zones, where it was used as a weapon of war by armed groups and by Congolese soldiers alike, the committee said. It was particularly concerned about the situation in the Kasai region, where the United Nations has said a rebel militia largely composed of children has been confronted by a militia suspected of a campaign of ethnic massacres and rapes. The United Nations has set up a fact-finding mission to investigate the Kasai atrocities, although the government has insisted Congo s justice system is in charge. It has acknowledged isolated human rights violations in the Kasai conflict and other conflict zones but denies its troops systematically use disproportionate force.  But the U.N. committee said Congo s National Human Rights Commission was unable to operate outside Kinshasa, had received no funds since March 2017, and was not regarded as independent.     ",0
65156,"US economy adds paltry 38,000 jobs in May for weakest growth since 2010","The US economy added just 38,000 jobs in May – 122,000 fewer than expected and the weakest growth since 2010. The unemployment rate slipped down to 4.7%, the Department of Labor announced on Friday.

The report added to concerns that the US economy is slowing, ahead of a crucial meeting of the Federal Reserve, and was immediately seized on by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. “Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38,000 jobs added. Bombshell!” he wrote on Twitter.

A strike by 40,000 Verizon workers impacted the numbers, the labor department said, and without the strike the number of jobs added would have been 72,000, which is still less than half the expected job growth.

The unemployment rate is now the lowest it has been since November 2007, and job gains in 2016 have slowed sharply from the 240,000 average of the last two years. On Friday, the Department of Labor also cut its assessment of the number of jobs added in March and April by 59,000.

“The weakness in May’s payrolls was widespread. Manufacturing lost 10,000 jobs, construction shed 15,000 jobs and temporary help fell by 21,000,” wrote Paul Ashworth, Capital Economics chief US economist, in a note to investors. “A June rate hike from the Fed is now very unlikely.”

May’s report is the last before the Fed’s next meeting on 14-15 June, when the US central bank may raise interest rates again. The gain was the smallest since September 2010 and is sure to add to speculation that a rate hike could be delayed until July, already uncertainty about Britain’s referendum to exit the EU. That vote will take place on 23 June.

After the economy added 160,000 jobs in April – 40,000 fewer than expected – economists expected the job growth in May to come in at 160,000. Over the past 12 months employment growth had averaged 232,000 jobs a month, but economists expected the 44-day strike of 40,000 Verizon workers to affect the May figures.



The last time Verizon workers went on strike, for two weeks in August 2011, the department of labor reported that the economy added no jobs that month. The following month, however, it reported a growth of 103,000 jobs and noted that the spike partially “reflected the return to payrolls of about 45,000” striking workers.

The recent strike ended last week after the labor department helped Verizon and the union representing the striking workers reach a tentative deal.

As job growth slows, Barack Obama has moved to defend his economic legacy. Earlier this week, while speaking in Elkhart, Indiana, he described the US economy as the “strongest, most durable economy in the world” and pointed out that over the past six years, US businesses have created more than 14m new jobs.

“Despite the drop in unemployment, wages are still growing too slowly, and that makes it harder to pay for college or save for retirement,” said Obama, before pointing out that so far this year, wages have grown at a rate of about 3%. Until recently, his administration had described wages as the unfinished business of this recovery.

Economists believe that a wage growth of 3% to 3.5% is necessary to help reach the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation goal.

Last week, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said that she expects the US labor market to continue to improve and that in the coming months it might be “appropriate” for the Fed to increase interest rates. In December, the Fed increased interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.

“I’m not sure it plays an important role in our policy making beyond us just monitoring the US data and general global financial conditions and having confidence that things are still on a good track,” Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, told CNBC on Friday. Evans, who is a non-voting member of the Fed’s policy-setting committee, said that he expects two rate hikes this year.

“As the labor market tightens we should see wage growth rise, however it’s clear that we are not at a level consistent with full employment. With wage growth this low, there is simply no threat of wage-led inflation,” said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. “The Fed should bear this in mind when it meets later this month and not be too quick to raise rates and slow the economy.”

A week ago, Yellen said that the US jobs market is nearing full employment.",0

The entire commentary is disturbing!Here s what the panel was referring to: This is priceless! President Trump just gave the best response ever to a reporter s question! He said he wanted to thank Russian President Vladimir Putin for reducing his payroll by firing U.S. embassy staff in Moscow. Hysterical and so quick! Watch how Trump doesn t skip a beat with his response:After Sanctions on Russia were put in place in July, Putin ordered 755 embassy personnel out of Russia.President Trump was asked today during a press conference what he thought of the firing. His response was quick and decisive. He said he wanted to thank Putin for the firing: No. I want to thank him, because we re trying to cut down on payroll. And as far as I m concerned, I m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll. He continued:  There s no real reason for them to go back. So I greatly appreciate the fact that they have been able to cut our payroll for the United States. We ll save a lot of money. THE TRUTH IS THAT THE CNN PANEL KNOWS NOTHING!

17369, The Hilarious Way WH Staff Secretly Signaled They Have No Idea Why Ivanka Is Allowed In Meetings,"When news broke that Ivanka Trump would be getting her very own office in the West Wing many assumed she would receive some sort of job to go along with it. Instead, she has been just sort of hanging out, floating to different meetings sporadically. If she wants to, say, meet the Japanese Prime Minister whose government is critical to greenlighting Trump business interests, she ll show up. If she wants to drop in on a closed-door meeting with business leaders to discuss policy, she ll do that too. Sometimes she is even sent to be Trump s spokesperson, a position she was never formally hired for.So what is Ivanka Trump s role in the White House? Nobody knows, not even Trump s own aides. Her only real qualification is shameless nepotism. However, rather than put  boss s daughter  on her placard, White House staffers panicked and just awkwardly ignored the situation altogether.

She s given completely unchecked access to Trump s administration, but her actual job is still selling clothing and cheap jewelry in retail stores. When many concerned Americans began boycotting her merchandise, Republicans were infuriated. Kellyanne Conway made sure to go on cable news to insist Americans should consider it their patriotic duty to buy her stuff if they truly supported the president.It s with those conflicts of interest in mind that Twitter user @Darth dreamed up his own title to put under Ivanka s name:@dorseyshaw pic.twitter.com/c9wyZjkftJ  darth:  (@darth) May 17, 2017He s not far off.

69274,Clinton ramps up Asian outreach in three closely fought states,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign is focusing an effort to win over Asian American voters on three states where it believes the small but rapidly growing group could make the difference in her race against Republican Donald Trump.     The push in closely fought Nevada, Virginia and Pennsylvania follows a broader national effort by Clinton’s campaign to court minorities who are critical to her chances of winning the White House in the Nov. 8 election. Asians make up less than 3.5 percent of the U.S. population, but are the fastest-growing racial group in the country, according to the U.S. Census, due largely to net migration, making them more important than ever in an election.  “Secretary Clinton understands the importance of the AAPI community and has launched a program that reflects that, reaching AAPI voters in unprecedented ways,” said Jason Tengco, the Clinton campaign’s outreach director for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI).  The three states were targeted because Asian voters could swing the outcome in the tight races between Trump and Clinton there.  The effort will include print, digital and broadcast advertising in a handful of Asian languages and more coordination among volunteer groups representing ethnic communities within the Asian American and Pacific Islander group, according to the campaign. Among the recent hires for the effort was Philip Kim, a Los Angeles native who previously worked with Senator Tim Kaine, Clinton’s running mate, as outreach director for Asian American and Pacific Islander voters in Nevada.  The campaign did not say how much the three-state push would cost.     While small, the Asian population could eclipse the margin of victory in each of the states Clinton is targeting. Asians  make up some 2.1 percent of eligible voters in Pennsylvania, 5 percent in Virginia and 9 percent in Nevada, according to APIAVote, a nonpartisan group.  Polling from Reuters/Ipsos shows Clinton with a mere 1 point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, a 6 point lead in Virginia, and a 2 point lead in Nevada.  The challenge will be to get Asian Americans to the polls. Asian American voters have tended to lean Democrat but register to vote much less frequently than whites and blacks. Asian registration was about 56.3 percent in 2012, according to the Census, versus 73.1 percent for black voters and 71.9 percent for white voters.  The number of Asian Americans voting in presidential elections rose from 2008 to 2012, according to the Census, which showed 4.3 million Asian voters in 2012 and a turnout of 47.9 percent.  “A big part of what we’re doing is voter registration,” said Xochitl Hinojosa, a Clinton spokeswoman. Clinton’s campaign has already done significant Asian outreach. It launched the “AAPI for Hillary” campaign to engage Asian voters in January and has done phone calling in a range of languages for months. But the campaign said the latest push was the first with state-specific programs. The Clinton campaign is considering advertisements in Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Chinese.  A spokesperson for Trump’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment about its Asian outreach.  The Trump campaign has, however, recently made some efforts to appeal to black and Latino voters to undercut Clinton, including a meeting on Thursday with Latino and black Republicans in New York. Trump has had problems with minorities in the past and has  angered some with his hardline anti-immigration rhetoric. He has accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug dealers over the border, vowed to build a wall to stop them and called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to shore up U.S. national security. Clinton leads Trump by 12 percentage points nationally among likely voters, bolstered by minority support, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. ",0
36135,Kenya president's election campaign used firm hired by Trump: privacy group,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - In the run-up to Kenya s August presidential election, the ruling party used divisive social media campaigns created by a U.S. company whose previous clients include President Donald Trump, a Britain-based privacy advocacy group said on Thursday. Two websites - one detailing the accomplishments of President Uhuru Kenyatta and the other attacking opposition leader Raila Odinga - share an IP address with Texas-based Harris Media LLC, according to Privacy International s report. Privacy International said the company used data analytics to target audiences using information gleaned from social media accounts in Kenya, where 1,200 people were killed in inter-ethnic violence after a disputed election a decade ago. Kenyans vote largely along ethnic lines, and candidates appeal to voters on that basis.  This raises serious concerns about the role and responsibility of companies working for political campaigns in Kenya, in which tribal affiliation and region of origin are particularly politically sensitive data, and volatile  coded language  was widely deployed,  Privacy International said. Social media in the East African nation were flooded with ads linking to the  Real Raila  and  Uhuru for Us  sites in the weeks before the Aug. 26 vote. An official for Kenyatta s Jubilee Party denied the report, saying it handled all its campaigns locally. The company, U.S.-based Harris Media LLC, did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment on the report. But the allegations by Privacy International recalled how, for the first time in Kenya s history, social media including fake news, hashtags and trolls dominated the public discussion and stoked tensions in the run-up to the hotly contested presidential election on Aug. 26. Kenyans went to the polls amid concerns over the credibility of the vote and bitter online hate campaigns stoking ethnic tensions, leading to fears of a return to the bloodshed that followed the disputed 2007 vote. The August vote was eventually nullified by the Supreme Court over irregularities. Kenyatta won an October re-run that Odinga boycotted. But violence marred the extended election season, and more than 70 people were killed, mainly by police. Raphael Tuju, Jubilee Party secretary general, denied the party had hired or used Harris Media.  We have heard a lot of those kinds of accusations. We were running a campaign from the Jubilee Headquarters, and we employed local communications experts, led by our own team, and that is it for us,  he told Reuters by phone. Days before the August vote, Facebook released a tool enabling Kenyan users to evaluate content displayed prominently when they log on. The tool contained tips on how to spot fake news, including checking web addresses and looking for other reports on the topic. ",0

President Peter Mutharika launched an investigation in January into the government order for 100,000 tonnes of Zambian white maize, after an opposition leader there said he had seen documents showing Malawi had been charged $345 per ton instead of the $215 the consignment was worth. Then agriculture minister George Chaponda was arrested in July, sacked and charged with abuse of office and possession of foreign currency without lawful justification. He pleaded not guilty to both charges and was released on bail pending trial, for which no date has yet been set. Malawi was importing maize to ease food shortages triggered by a severe drought that swept the region in 2016. According to court documents seen by Reuters, Finance Minister Goodall Gondwe, Information Nicoluas Dausi and Trade and Industry Minister Henry Mussa will be called to give evidence against Chaponda. The three ministers, who declined to comment, are expected to testify late this month, local newspapers said. Malawi s Anti-Corruption Bureau also declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
