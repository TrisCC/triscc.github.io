46446,"Obama: Trump doesn't know much about foreign policy, world","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday that Donald Trump’s recent comments that South Korea and Japan should acquire nuclear weapons show the leading Republican presidential candidate is not well informed on international relations. Trump told The New York Times in an interview published on Sunday that he would consider letting the countries build their own nuclear weapons, rather than having them count on U.S. protection against North Korea and China. Obama has made no secret of his disdain for the billionaire businessman, and he continued that theme with his repudiation of Trump’s pronouncements. “What do the statements you mentioned tell us?” Obama told reporters at a news conference at the conclusion of a nuclear security summit. “They tell us that the person who made the statements doesn’t know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean peninsula, or the world generally.” Obama said Trump’s candidacy had come up as a topic with world leaders on the sidelines of the summit, and he lamented the state of the Republican race. “Even ... those countries that are used to a carnival atmosphere in their own politics want sobriety and clarity when it comes to U.S. elections because they understand the president of the United States needs to know what’s going on around the world,” he said. Obama took apart Trump’s positions point by point.  The U.S. alliance with Japan and South Korea was one of the cornerstones of America’s presence in the Asia Pacific region and had underwritten peace and prosperity there, he said.  The relationship had been a boon to U.S. commerce and influence in addition to preventing nuclear escalation and conflict, he added. “You don’t mess with that. It is an investment that rests on the sacrifices that our men and women made back in World War II when they were fighting throughout the Pacific,” Obama said. “We don’t want somebody in the Oval Office who doesn’t recognize how important that is.” ",0
3656,Factbox: Can Trump kill NFL stadium tax breaks? Five facts to consider,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday stepped up his war of words over National Football League players’ silent protests against racial injustice, saying the world’s top-grossing sports league should not be given tax breaks while athletes kneel during the national anthem. The NFL gave up its tax-free status two years ago, but new or renovated stadiums are often funded at least in part by tax-exempt municipal bonds issued by local governments or states. Team owners benefit from government financing via lower interest rate bonds backed by team lease payments, stadium-generated revenue and even tax dollars.  The administration could push for changes to the laws that allow professional sports teams to enjoy tax breaks normally aimed at city governments. Below are five facts about the financing of sports stadiums. 1) Laws allowing teams to fund stadiums with tax-exempt bonds have cost the United States $3.7 billion in lost tax revenue from 2000 through 2014, according to a Brookings Institution paper released last year, a figure that reflects the lower interest rates paid on municipal debt and the tax exemption for bondholders. 2) Of the 16 NFL stadiums built or renovated from 2000 through 2014, 13 were financed in part by tax-exempt bonds with an average financing worth $360.2 million, according to Brookings, a Washington-based policy think tank. 3) Trump could propose tax reform legislation to remove the federal tax exemptions on debt financing for stadiums. However federal changes would not necessarily hinder any potential incentives offered by state and local authorities. The latest and largest subsidy offered to an NFL franchise is the $750 million Las Vegas is using to lure the Oakland Raiders to a $1.9 billion stadium. The money will come from public funds raised via a visitors’ tax on Las Vegas strip hotel rooms. 4) There are two bipartisan bills, one in the Senate and one in the House, before the U.S. Congress that seek to remove federal tax exempt status for bonds tied to sports stadiums by treating them as private activity bonds. 5) Former U.S. President Barack Obama proposed in two previous budgets for 2015 and 2016 legislation to eliminate the tax exemptions on stadium financing, Brookings said.

43369,"Split by ‘Brexit,’ May and Merkel Diverge on Wider Issues, Too - The New York Times","LONDON  —   In another era they could have been allies. Both vicars’ daughters and born just a few years apart, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain share an understated pragmatism and conservative roots, and have made their way in the still largely man’s world of politics. But there could be so much more. At a time when President Trump is lashing out at friend and foe, and when the macho politics of strongmen is resurgent from Moscow to Manila, when not just the European Union but   Western values, free trade and security alliances are under attack, the two women might have worked together to defend the liberal global order. Instead, because of Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union, they find themselves on opposite sides of the biggest divorce in recent European history, a chasm that has fundamentally reordered their priorities and is hindering them from cooperating on the broader issues. At a meeting of European leaders in Malta last week, Mrs. May and Ms. Merkel abruptly canceled a planned bilateral meeting after a brief exchange during a sightseeing excursion was deemed enough. After lunch, when it came to discussing the threats facing Europe, Mrs. May was shown the door. Their differing priorities were on ample display this past week as they dealt with both Mr. Trump and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Ms. Merkel, whose overriding strategic ambition as Germany’s leader is to save the European Union, has kept her distance from Mr. Trump. After his election, she firmly outlined the liberal values on which she was prepared to work with him, and she swiftly condemned his travel ban aimed at seven   countries. Mrs. May, whose priority is to sign bilateral trade deals to offset her country’s departure from Europe’s single market, rushed to be the first foreign leader received by Mr. Trump after he took office. Apparently pleased to be caught on camera holding his hand, she extended a speedy invitation for a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II. “Opposites attract,” she beamed. The invitation has since become a polarizing issue in Britain’s sharply divided political landscape, and reinforced a view on the Continent that as Britain cuts ties with Europe, it will become America’s lap dog. “It’s chalk and cheese,” said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European history at Oxford. “But none of this tells you very much about the contrasting character of the two women. It tells you about the contrasting positions of the two countries. ” If Ms. Merkel can still afford to be an idealist, Britain’s plan to leave the European Union, or “Brexit,” has turned Mrs. May into a calculating realist. Within hours of leaving Mr. Trump, she was on a plane to Turkey. Upon arriving, Mrs. May waffled in her judgment of Mr. Trump’s travel ban, later stiffening her criticism after a public outcry. She also negotiated a deal with Turkey involving the British defense company BAE Systems. Five days later, Ms. Merkel paid her own visit to Mr. Erdogan and looked far clearer in her resolve when faced with the autocratic Turkish leader, calmly noting that she had raised controversial issues like press freedom and Turkey’s future Constitution. Privately, German officials express some sympathy for Mrs. May’s sometimes clumsy diplomacy, understanding that she needs new partners if she is to make good on her promise of a “Global Britain. ” But only occasionally have there been glimpses of the partnership that might have been. In July, Ms. Merkel was almost effusive in welcoming Mrs. May, who chose Berlin for her first foreign trip as prime minister. The German chancellor emphasized their countries’ “common values. ” During a news conference, both women stiffly answered questions about Brexit. Then a journalist asked about their first impressions of each other. Their body language visibly loosened. Ms. Merkel laughed, and Mrs. May said, “We have two women here who, if I may say so, want to get on with the job. ” Their shared gender has led to many lazy comparisons, said Rosa Prince, the author of a biography of Mrs. May that is to be published this month. “When you are a female political leader of a certain age, you are inevitably compared to Margaret Thatcher and Angela Merkel,” she said. “Theresa May is nothing like Margaret Thatcher, but as it happens has quite a lot in common with Angela Merkel. ” Each cautious and deliberate, they are both childless, have quiet husbands and enjoy watching sports. (Ms. Merkel knows soccer Mrs. May prefers cricket.) An Oxford graduate and lawmaker since 1997, Mrs. May was Britain’s   home secretary of modern times before taking over from Prime Minister David Cameron in the confusion that followed the Brexit referendum. As Ms. Prince put it, “She was the last woman standing after all the men got burned or ran away. ” Ms. Merkel, a scientist before she went into politics, is long used to being the only woman in the room. Evelyn Roll, a German biographer of Ms. Merkel, said that, on the advice of a German actress, the chancellor had deliberately lowered the pitch of her voice to deter men from talking over her. Both women endured condescension and outright misogyny as they rose. Mrs. May has been called a “bloody difficult woman” by a fellow minister. Ms. Merkel’s predecessor and mentor, Helmut Kohl, patronized her as “my girl. ” Even after Ms. Merkel unseated Mr. Kohl as leader of the Christian Democrats amid a party financing scandal, Germany’s   news media belittled her as efficient but bland  —   until she took office in 2005 and gradually became “Mutti,” the mother of the nation. “The only way men can process that a woman is in power is apparently to liken her to their mother,” Ms. Roll said. Ms. Merkel, who grew up in Germany’s former Communist east, has never branded herself a feminist. But on her watch Germany has introduced boardroom quotas for women and created a generous system of paid parental leave shared between mothers and fathers. Mrs. May once wore a   that read, “This is what a feminist looks like. ” In 2005, Mrs. May   a group called Women2Win to elect more women to Parliament and then nurture them, something that Mrs. Thatcher was often criticized for not doing. “They are both serious people who don’t grandstand, who don’t play for the gallery,” said Charles Grant, the director of the   Center for European Reform. But the few times the two women have met privately have been highly scripted affairs with little warmth on display, according to one person who was present at more than one of their meetings. “Theresa May is not good at small talk,” said Ms. Prince, the biographer. “She is not an easygoing, smooth person. She is not a natural diplomat. ” Ms. Merkel, however, is said to respect Mrs. May, considering her the “ ” in the British government, officials close to the chancellor say. For her part, Mrs. May has long expressed admiration for the German chancellor. “There are still people who don’t rate her, are a bit dismissive, perhaps because of the way she looks and dresses,” Mrs. May said in a 2012 interview with The Daily Telegraph. “What matters is, what has she actually done? And when you look at her abilities in terms of negotiation and steering Germany through a difficult time, then hats off to her. ” The two will soon be on the opposite side of the negotiations as Brexit talks commence. There is no wish in Berlin to “punish” Britain for leaving, said Peter Torry, Britain’s ambassador in Germany until 2007, who still lives in the German capital. But Berlin’s tone has grown more distant as Britain’s resolve to leave has hardened and their interests diverge. Mrs. May has said she will turn Britain into a   competitor if no favorable deal is offered by the European Union by the end of a   negotiation. But given her promises for a fairer society, that proposal is not considered credible or workable by many business and political leaders in Europe. Nor is her offer to be a bridge to the new American president. At a news conference in Malta after the European Union summit meeting on Friday, Ms. Merkel was asked whether Germany should lower its corporation tax in line with the reductions signaled by Mrs. May and Mr. Trump. “We have a tax system in Germany that is weathering challenges well,” Ms. Merkel said, suggesting that   societies rely on raising a fair amount of tax. One reason for the difference between the two women’s approaches may be that one is just starting out as head of government, while the other has been in office for over a decade. “May is like Merkel 10 years ago,” Ms. Roll said. Though sometimes accused of lacking a vision for Europe, Ms. Merkel is calm and strategic, said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations’ research institute in Berlin. “That’s obviously helpful in a situation where we risk seeing a lot of provocations coming out of Washington over the next few years,” she said. By contrast, Ms. Schwarzer added, Mrs. May seems “more tactical at this point. ” One leader is consumed by preparing Britain’s departure from the European Union, and the other with keeping the bloc together. Could they develop a pragmatic relationship during the Brexit talks and beyond? “It won’t be a smooth ride,” Ms. Prince said, “but it certainly has a better chance of succeeding with these two levelheaded women at the top. ”",0

A federal court jury delivered a surprise verdict on Thursday acquitting anti-governme leader Ammon Bundy and six followers of conspiracy charges stemming from their role in the armed takeover of a wildlife center in Oregon earlier this year. The outcome marked a stinging defeat for federal prosecutors and law enforcement in a trial the defendants sought to turn into a pulpit for airing their opposition to U.S. government control over millions of acres of public lands in the West. Bundy and others, including his brother and co-defendant Ryan Bundy, cast the 41-day occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge as a patriotic act of civil disobedience.

71135,"Obama to keep 5,500 US troops in Afghanistan beyond 2016","President Obama announced Thursday he will keep 5,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan beyond 2016, in a stark reversal from earlier pledges to end the war on his watch -- though Republicans still questioned whether the residual force will be enough to support Afghan forces and U.S. allies.

The decision follows months of appeals from military leaders to extend the drawdown timeline. And it marks an acknowledgement that, despite claims Al Qaeda is on the run, militants continue to pose a serious threat to the country.

Obama originally had planned to pull out all but a small, embassy-based U.S. military presence by the end of next year. But military leaders argued the Afghans needed additional assistance and support from the U.S. to beat back a resurgent Taliban and hold onto gains made over the last 14 years.

Under the new plan, the administration will keep the current force of 9,800 troops in Afghanistan through most of next year, then draw down to 5,500 troops in 2017, at a pace still to be determined by commanders.

""While America's combat mission in Afghanistan may be over, our commitment to Afghanistan and its people endures,"" Obama said at the White House, in announcing his decision.

The president stressed that he does ""not support the idea of endless war,"" but said Afghan forces are ""not as strong as they need to be"" and the Taliban have ""made gains,"" leading to a ""very fragile"" security situation in key areas of the country.

He called the new plan the ""best possibility for lasting progress in Afghanistan,"" while saying the U.S. mission ""will not change"" even after 2016.

Concerns about Afghan security were reinforced when Taliban fighters took control of Kunduz late last month, prompting a protracted battle with Afghan forces on the ground, supported by U.S. airstrikes. During the fighting, a U.S. airstrike hit a hospital, killing 22 people, including 12 Doctors Without Borders staff and 10 patients.

U.S. commanders have also expressed concern about Islamic State fighters moving into the country and gaining recruits from within the Taliban. And on another front, the U.S. military launched a major operation against two Al Qaeda camps in Kandahar earlier this month; one of the camps reportedly was almost 30 square miles. The operation included dozens of airstrikes.

Republicans welcomed Obama's decision Thursday to keep more troops in the country to deal with these threats -- but questioned whether 5,500 troops would be enough.

""I am pleased that President Obama has decided to keep U.S. troops in Afghanistan to perform the right missions beyond 2016, both in and outside of Kabul,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. ""However, I am concerned that the number of troops will not be sufficient to perform the critical tasks being set for them: counterterrorism and continuing to train and advise our Afghan partners. ...

""The bottom line is that 5,500 troops will only be adequate to conduct either the counterterrorism or the train and advise mission, but not both. Our military commanders have said that both are critical to prevent Afghanistan from spiraling into chaos.""

Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., told Fox News there was ""no way"" Afghan forces could have tackled the Taliban if all U.S. forces withdrew. ""This was a disaster waiting to happen,"" he said. But he called the president's compromise plan a ""containment"" strategy and questioned whether the ""small number"" would be enough.

""While this new plan avoids a disaster, it is certainly not a plan for success,"" Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. He also criticized the president for threatening to veto defense legislation ""that provides their pay, benefits, and the authorities they need to get the job done"" -- in reference to an ongoing dispute over a defense authorization bill that would bust budget caps.

U.S. officials have been hinting at the policy shift for weeks, noting that conditions on the ground in Afghanistan have changed since Obama's initial decision on a sharper troop withdrawal timeline was made more than two years ago. The White House has also been buoyed by having a more reliable partner in Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who succeeded the mercurial Hamid Karzai last year.

""The narrative that we're leaving Afghanistan is self-defeating,"" Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Wednesday during a speech at the Association of the U.S. Army. ""We're not, we can't, and to do so would not be to take advantage of the success we've had to date.""

Asked Thursday if 5,500 troops is enough, Carter said, ""We did a lot of homework on this."" He maintained that the troop presence, along with continued financial assistance and training for the Afghan military, ""are the ingredients to continue the prosecution of the mission.""

The troops staying in Afghanistan beyond next year will continue to focus on counterterrorism missions and training and advising Afghan security forces, officials said. They will be based in Kabul and Bagram Air Field, as well as bases in Jalalabad and Kandahar.

The president's decision to keep the U.S. military in Afghanistan beyond his tenure thrusts the conflict into the 2016 presidential race. The next president will become the third U.S. commander in chief to oversee the war, with the options of trying to bring it to a close, maintaining the presence as Obama left it or even ramping up U.S. involvement in the conflict.

Officials said discussions on staying in Afghanistan longer began during Ghani's visit to Washington in March. The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Campbell, recently presented the president with a range of options calling for keeping more troops there. Officials said NATO allies had expressed support for extending the troop presence in Afghanistan, but they did not outline any specific commitments from other nations.

Obama campaigned for the White House on a pledge to end America's involvement in the two wars he inherited, Iraq and Afghanistan. Now, he'll likely finish his presidency with troops back in both countries.

The president did withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq in late 2011, a moment he heralded as a promise kept to a war-weary nation. But the rise of the Islamic State drew the U.S. military back into Iraq last year to train and assist local security forces and launch airstrikes.

Obama announced the end of the Afghan war with similar fanfare last spring, saying it was time for the U.S. to ""turn the page"" on more than a decade of deadly conflicts.

In March, at a press conference with Ghani, he said, ""The date for us to have completed our drawdown will not change.""

18841,Trump's Chicago rally called off for safety reasons amid chaos,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled a rally scheduled for Friday night in Chicago after the event turned into a chaotic scene with thousands of attendees split into opposing camps of supporters of the Republican front-runner and protesters inflamed by his candidacy. A Trump campaign staffer took the stage nearly a half hour after the rally was slated to begin and said it would be postponed for safety reasons. A campaign statement issued slightly later said the event would be held on another unspecified day. Following the announcement, the crowd began to chant and cheer. Scuffles broke out as signs were ripped from hands and police moved in to quickly defuse the most serious scuffles.  Cries of “We dumped Trump! We dumped Trump!” rose inside the University of Illinois at Chicago pavilion where the event was held. An opposing group yelled: “We want Trump! We want Trump!”  Outside the pavilion, chants of “We shut it down!” rippled through the crowd on news of the cancellation. Chicago activists had spent the week leading up to the rally planning how to disrupt it. Trump has become a particularly polarizing candidate in the presidential campaign. He has both inspired impassioned supporters and ignited a backlash of angry dissent with his promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants and his call to temporarily ban the entry of Muslims into the country. One group at Friday’s event, Showing Up for Racial Justice, coordinated with minority student groups on campuses, using group email chains and messaging so that protesters could stay in constant communication.  One of the organizers, Nathaniel Lewis, 25, a master’s degree student in public health at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said he was shocked they succeeded in shutting the rally down. “I’m happy, I’m at peace because we came together as a collective,” Lewis told Reuters.  “This is the last thing we expected to happen, it shows the power of unity.” Trump, speaking to MSNBC by telephone shortly after the canceled event, said he met with law enforcement after arriving in Chicago. Though he believed it would have been possible to move forward, he said he made the “wise decision” to postpone the rally to keep everyone safe. “We were not consulted or involved in the decision to cancel the event,” Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters. Trump brushed off questions from MSNBC’s Chris Matthews about whether such widespread disruptions were to be expected given the increasingly aggressive tenor of recent campaign events. Trump said his supporters had planned for a peaceful rally but it was derailed by the crowd of protesters. “You can’t even have a rally in a major city in this country anymore,” Trump said. “Up until this point we’ve had no problem.” Trump told MSNBC he expected support for his candidacy would only increase. Earlier in the day, at a rally in St. Louis, Missouri, Trump had been speaking for less than 10 minutes when protesters began interrupting him. The disruptions continued over the next hour as Trump urged security to “get them out.” “Can I be honest with you, it adds to the flavor, it’s more exciting. Isn’t this better than listening to a long boring speech?” Trump said of the disruptions. At some events, altercations have turned physical. In New Orleans last week, several protesters supporting the Black Lives Matter movement were dragged out as Trump shouted “get them.” In Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Wednesday, protesters interrupted Trump’s speech more than 16 times. One was punched as he was led from the arena. Jedidiah Brown, 29, dashed onto the Chicago stage where Trump was expected to speak Friday and tore the campaign sign from the podium before police took him outside. He was not arrested. “I was born and raised in Chicago so I felt it was my responsibility to let him know he’s not welcome here,” Brown said. “The message Trump is spreading all over the country, it doesn’t work here.” Outside, Tess King, 25, a social sciences and law student, was carrying a sign that said “Chicago Rejects Trump.” King had tried to get into the rally but the event was canceled before she got in the door. “I feel incredibly happy that in our city we managed, through peaceful expression, to make this happen,” King told Reuters. As the crowd began to trickle out, Josh Glaspie, 28, smoked a cigarette on a sidewalk strewn with discarded signs. Glaspie, an Army veteran who is trying to open a restaurant in Chicago, said he supports Trump. “Trump’s not racist,” Glaspie said. “These people don’t even know why they’re protesting.”  (Additional reporting by Ginger Gibson, Eric Walsh and Amanda Becker; Writing by Amanda Becker; Editing by Leslie Adler, Robert Birsel) This article was funded in part by SAP.

34520,Most French think Macron's tax policies favor the rich: poll,"PARIS (Reuters) - A large majority of people in France believe President Emmanuel Macron s tax policies favor the rich, a poll showed on Thursday, days after he angered unions with disparaging remarks about protesters. Eighty-two percent of respondents in the Odoxa poll thought Macron s tax policies - including a scaling-back of a long-standing wealth tax - catered mainly to the richest. Three in four said the policy helped heads of large businesses and fewer than one in three believed Macron s tax stance was favorable for low-income workers and pensioners. This month, Macron made good on a pledge to scale back the wealth tax, long a tool for social justice for left-wingers but blamed by others for driving millionaires abroad. He is scrapping the tax on all but property holdings, a move that critics said was a get-out for owners of yachts and private jets, while reducing housing subsidies for the poor. The 39-year-old leader, who argues that the left- and right-wing politics are an anachronism, is struggling to shake off the elitist image of his years as a Rothschild banker. He has argued that the economy, which has suffered from chronic unemployment and sluggish growth for years, needs entrepreneurship, foreign investment and rewards for risk-taking. But he was criticized after complaining about  lazy  elements of society and saying that people who clashed with police during a protest at a car parts plant should seek work elsewhere. Macron s approval ratings have tumbled since his election in May, dragged down by labor reforms, budget cuts, and the decrease in housing subsidies.  An Ifop poll in late September showed some respite with a  dissatisfaction  rating of 53 percent down from 57 percent in August. An August Harris Interactive poll showed 46 percent trusted Macron s political leadership, 13 points off his mid-June high - making him the most unpopular French president in the first 100 days in office in decades. Macron hopes to weather further protests as his government unfurls more reforms aimed at making hiring and firing easier.  Some unions say that will undermine labor protections. On Thursday, protesters put on a show of force near a meeting of human resources executives on the western edge of Paris. Police arrested 41 people at the protest in which several executives  cars were torched. (This refiled version of the story fixes typo  Eighty-two  in second paragraph). ",0
4287,Gorka on Syria: ‘No Endgame That Involves Us Being Global Police Officer’,"Dr. Sebastian Gorka, former Breitbart News National Security editor and current deputy assistant to President Trump, discussed Syria policy on Wednesday’s edition of Breitbart News Daily. [SiriusXM host Alex Marlow suggested there were too many conflicting statements coming from various Trump administration officials about Syria, but Gorka insisted “we have absolute clarity. ”  “You just have to listen to the president, the  ” he advised. “He has been explicit, and nothing has changed from November the 8th to today. ” “We sent a very clear message concerning the use of weapons of mass destruction against women and children, but the president has said we have no interest in invading other people’s countries and occupying them. This isn’t the Bush administration of 2003, nor is it the first Gulf War of 1991. These things are very, very clear,” Gorka asserted. Marlow countered by playing a clip of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seeming to endorse regime change in Syria. “I think it’s clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,” Tillerson declared. Gorka said it was “not a binary proposition” to call for regime change without also committing the United States to a military intervention. “Nothing that Secretary Tillerson said has anything to do with an invasion or forced removal of Assad. Nothing,” he said. “Everybody’s on the same sheet of music, whether it’s the Secretary of State, whether it’s Secretary Mattis, whether it’s General McMaster the National Security Adviser. They all follow the lead of the   . ”  “There’s more than one way  —   there are dozens of different ways that one individual can step down from power. He doesn’t have to be removed,” Gorka argued. “That’s why the action we took last Thursday was so seminal. We sent a message to the sponsors of this regime. ” “Remember this is a satrapy, it’s a client state of other nations,” he explained. “The message we sent is, there is a point at which an individual like Assad, when he does things as heinous as using chemical weapons against unarmed women and children, the   analysis for his sponsors  —   Moscow included  —   has to be reassessed. ”  “When that is reassessed, if he loses the sponsorship of places like the Kremlin, it becomes much easier for him to be forced out of office politically, not by force, because he simply loses the confidence of his supporters and also the people around him. Remember, Alex, Assad is just one man. He doesn’t have to be removed through force. He can be removed politically. We went a great distance towards that political resolution by the actions we took last week,” said Gorka. Marlow noted that much of President Trump’s voting base was “not expecting him to proactively get involved in foreign entanglements that did not directly impact the national security of America. ” “Number One, this did impact our national security directly,” Gorka responded. “Whether you live in San Bernardino, Boston, or whether you live anywhere else in the United States, the idea that you have the free use of chemical weapons in a war zone  —   where ISIS, our primary threat, is recruiting, is functioning, can access those weapons  —   that is a primary threat to the United States. ” “Secondly, this isn’t a ‘foreign entanglement’ in the way that our Founding Fathers described it,” he continued. “I say to your listeners, and this is a very important question  —   I understand the concerns, but really the people who voted for the president should not be concerned. ”  “Just compare the difference between two things: the invasion of 150, 160 thousand soldiers and Marines into a given theater, whether it’s Gulf I, whether it’s 2003  —   compare that please to the launching of 59 vehicles from the Med, from a ship in absolute safety, targeting one airfield used to launch those weapons,” he urged. “These two things are incomparable, and let’s have a little bit of sophistication in our analysis. One does not lead to the other. ” Marlow mentioned fears that even if American military actions remain as limited and   as Gorka described, there was still a danger we could be pressed into service as “the world’s policeman,” with an enormous number of atrocities around the world demanding our attention. “There is no intent, no desire, no endgame that involves us being a global police officer. Absolutely not,” Gorka replied. “With regard to the awful things that happen in mass numbers every day around the world, we have a different perspective,” he continued. “It’s not the last eight years, when the Obama administration looked at the world as it would like it to be, as opposed to how it is. This president is a pragmatist. You don’t get to be the most successful real estate mogul in New York, the toughest market in America, for 40 years unless you are a pragmatist. ” “We are interested in the overlap between moral imperative and national security. Strategy is exactly like politics: it is the art of the possible. We take action not because there is a global interest we take action because there is a national security interest, which sometimes may overlap with the global interest with regard to human rights or the use of chemical weapons,” Gorka said.  “The primary driving metric for everything the president does, because this is his primary mission, is the safety of the American people. In this case, this has nothing to do with being a globocop. This has to do with ISIS in theater, weapons of mass destruction, and the stability of the Middle East,” he stressed. Marlow said the Trump voting base was also wary of increased tensions with Russia, and was hoping the Russians could prove useful in defeating the Islamic State once and for all. He asked if the increasingly adversarial relationship between Presidents Trump and Putin was a response to “CNN conspiracy theories” about Russian interference in the 2016 election. Gorka responded by emphasizing Trump’s instincts as a pragmatist.  “The statements coming out of Moscow should not be taken at face value. Remember who Putin was. Remember what this regime has done in the last 12 years,” he added. Gorka quoted Trump’s response to a question at a press conference about relations with Russia: “I would like, if possible, to have good relations with Moscow. Right now, it doesn’t really seem like that’s possible. If that’s the case, so be it. ” “We do not make the national security interests of the United States hostage to other people’s opinions and propaganda,” he declared. “As a result, the president will keep his course. ” Marlow brought up White House spokesman Sean Spicer’s   gaffe comparing Syrian dictator Bashar Assad to Adolf Hitler, and said he hoped no one in the White House seriously thought Assad was in a league with Hitler. “Of course not,” Gorka replied. “Let’s close down the conspiracy theories. ” Marlow said it would not be easy to make the Left take that advice, because they are in “total meltdown over this, hysteria mode, even accusing him of Holocaust denial. ” “I’m used to it. This is what we’ve been living with for 12 weeks now: the absolutely   absurd fixation on   short little clips of interviews taken out of context to spin up fake news,” Gorka sighed. “Everybody knows that Sean misspoke, and he stated so,” he continued. “I want to say one thing to my colleague Sean, and everybody I think knows this: outside of the Oval Office, Sean Spicer is a great patriot, a great American, probably has the toughest job in America. If you offered me that job, I wouldn’t take it with a gun to my head. We have to recognize his professionalism. Sometimes you stumble, and he did yesterday, but he’s made up for it. Let’s move on. ” Turning to North Korea, Gorka reiterated his   determination not to “give away the playbook” on strategy, but allowed that there was a “similar dynamic” with North Korea and Syria. “North Korea doesn’t function without sponsorship, and we know who sponsors it,” he elaborated. “We are reasserting American leadership in the world. We’re filling the vacuum created by the last administration everywhere, including in Asia. ”  “I’ll simply put it this way: our actions are a forceful expression of our intent to provide leadership in the world and stability. We have    actors. North Korea is one of them. Our actions send a very clear message to those people that sponsor rogue regimes like North Korea, that they too  —   like Russia with regard to Syria  —   have to reassess their   analysis, and the calculation of how long they should support regimes like North Korea. Because North Korea is a destabilizing factor for all the nations of the region, and is a threat. That’s the message we’re sending,” said Gorka.

8394,Trump strikes blow at Iran nuclear deal in major U.S. policy shift,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump struck a blow against the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement on Friday in defiance of other world powers, choosing not to certify that Tehran is complying with the deal and warning he might ultimately terminate it. Trump announced the major shift in U.S. policy in a speech in which he detailed a more aggressive approach to Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for extremist groups in the Middle East. He accused Iran of  not living up to the spirit  of the nuclear agreement and said his goal is to ensure Tehran never obtains a nuclear weapon, in effect throwing the fate of the deal to Congress.  He singled out Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for sanctions and delivered a blistering critique of Tehran, which he accused of destabilizing actions in Syria, Yemen and Iraq.  We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran s nuclear breakout,  Trump said. Trump s hardline remarks drew praise from Israel, Iran s arch-foe, but was criticized by European allies. The move by Trump was part of his  America First  approach to international agreements which has led him to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. His Iran strategy angered Tehran and put Washington at odds with other signatories of the accord - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union - some of which have benefited economically from renewed trade with Iran. Responding to Trump, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday on television that Tehran was committed to the deal and accused Trump of making baseless accusations.  The Iranian nation has not and will never bow to any foreign pressure,  he said.  Iran and the deal are stronger than ever.  European allies have warned of a split with the United States over the nuclear agreement and say that putting it in limbo as Trump has done undermines U.S. credibility abroad, especially as international inspectors say Iran is in compliance with the accord.                 The chief of the U.N. atomic watchdog reiterated that Iran was under the world s  most robust nuclear verification regime.   The nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under the JCPOA are being implemented,  Yukiya Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency said, referring to the deal by its formal name. U.S. Democrats expressed skepticism at Trump s decision. Senator Ben Cardin said:  At a moment when the United States and its allies face a nuclear crisis with North Korea, the president has manufactured a new crisis that will isolate us from our allies and partners.  While Trump did not pull the United States out of the agreement, he gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact. If Congress reimposes the sanctions, the United States would in effect be in violation of the terms of the nuclear deal and it would likely fall apart. If lawmakers do nothing, the deal remains in place. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker was working on amending the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act law to include  trigger points  that if crossed by Iran would automatically reimpose U.S. sanctions. The trigger points would address strengthening nuclear inspections, Iran s ballistic missile program and eliminate the deal s  sunset clauses  under which some of the restrictions on Iran s nuclear program expire over time.  Trump directed U.S. intelligence agencies to probe whether Iran might be working with North Korea on its weapons programs. The president, who took office in January, had reluctantly certified the agreement twice before but has repeatedly blasted it as  the worst deal ever.  It was negotiated under his predecessor, former President Barack Obama. Trump warned that if  we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.   We ll see what happens over the next short period of time and I can do that instantaneously,  he told reporters when asked why he did not choose to scrap the deal now. The Trump administration designated the entire Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps under an executive order targeting terrorists. The administration stopped short of labeling the group a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a list maintained by the State Department. The Revolutionary Guard is the single most dominant player in Iran s security, political, and economic systems and wields enormous influence in Iran s domestic and foreign policies. It had already previously been sanctioned by the United States under other authorities, and the immediate impact of Friday s measure is likely to be symbolic. The U.S. military said on Friday it was identifying new areas where it could work with allies to put pressure on Iran in support of Trump s new strategy and was reviewing the positioning of U.S. forces. But U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said no changes in force posture had been made yet, and Iran had not responded to Trump s announcement with any provocative acts so far. ",0
35644,Factbox: Trump plan to dismantle 'Dreamer' program draws strong responses,"(Reuters) - The Trump administration drew vigorous responses to its announcement on Tuesday it would be ending an Obama-era program that allows children to stay in the United States who entered the country illegally.  Business executives, politicians and rights groups were outspoken in their reactions to the plan to dismantle the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), whose beneficiaries were known as Dreamers. “Kicking them out won’t lower the unemployment rate or lighten anyone’s taxes or raise anybody’s wages ... Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America or whether we treat them the way we’d want our own kids to be treated.  It’s about who we are as a people – and who we want to be.” - Former President Barack Obama in a statement  * “Today is a cruel day for Dreamers, our families, and all Americans ... President Trump just threw the lives and futures of 800,000 Dreamers and their families, including my own, into fearful disarray, and injected chaos and uncertainty into thousands of workplaces and communities across America. He is using the lives of 800,000 people as pawns.” - Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy for the American Civil Liberties Union * “It is my hope that the House and Senate, with the president’s leadership, will be able to find consensus on a permanent legislative solution that includes ensuring that those who have done nothing wrong can still contribute as a valued part of this great country.” - Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan in a statement * “This is a sad day for our country. The decision to end DACA is not just wrong. It is particularly cruel to offer young people the American Dream, encourage them to come out of the shadows and trust our government, and then punish them for it ... It’s time for Congress to act to pass the bipartisan Dream Act or another legislative solution that gives Dreamers a pathway to citizenship.” - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post * “President Obama wrongly believed he had the authority to re-write our immigration law. Today’s action by President Trump corrects that fundamental mistake. This Congress will continue working on securing our border and ensuring a lawful system of immigration that works.” - Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell * “I applaud President Trump for phasing out DACA ... The Obama-era program went far beyond the executive branch’s legitimate authority ... President (Barack) Obama unilaterally conferred lawful presence and work authorization, and then President Obama used that lawful-presence dispensation to unilaterally confer U.S. citizenship.” - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton * “Let’s lay the truth bare: President Trump has knowingly deceived the American people over the past seven months about his intentions to protect the innocent young men and women of the DACA program ... Now they will be awake at night wondering whether tomorrow will be their last day on American soil.” - Javier Palomarez, president of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, in a statement also announcing his resignation from Trump’s diversity council * “When people come here to learn, work hard and give back to their communities, we should allow them to stay in the United States.” JPMorgan Chase & Co chief executive Jamie Dimon, chairman of the Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs of the nation’s largest companies * “DACA was an unconstitutional overreach by the Obama administration that created incentives for children from Central America to take great risks to enter America illegally. The president has given Congress six months to get our act together and fix our broken legal immigration system, end incentives for illegal entry, lawfully protect the Dreamers, and secure our borders.” - Republican Senator Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee * “In our view, DACA was an unconstitutional abuse of executive authority by President Obama ... Congress should seize this opportunity to come together and forge these much-needed reforms in our nation’s immigration policy.” - Statement from the Federation for American Immigration Reform * “We say this even though Microsoft ... cares greatly about modernizing the tax system and making it fairer and more competitive. But we need to put the humanitarian needs of these 800,000 people on the legislative calendar before a tax bill.” - Microsoft president Brad Smith in a statement, adding that Microsoft has at least 39 Dreamers and will pay for their legal counsel in fighting to stay in the United States ",0
53950,"Xi Jinping Wants to Be ‘Comrade.’ For Gay Chinese, That Means Something Else. - The New York Times","BEIJING  —   To the 90 million or so members of China’s Communist Party, President Xi Jinping has a message: Don’t call me president. Don’t call me party secretary. Call me “comrade. ” There is just one problem. In recent decades, the once ubiquitous term for Communist cadres and leaders has been embraced and popularized by a different group of people: gay men and lesbians. The term “tongzhi,” or “comrade,” was a nearly universal form of address in China well into the 1980s, but as Mao jackets gave way to   suits and ties, it fell out of favor among Chinese officials. Among gay men, however, “tongzhi” became a term of affection and solidarity and eventually a catchall label for sexual minorities. A gay and lesbian film festival held annually in Hong Kong has been called the Hong Kong Comrade Film Festival since 1989. And the Beijing center for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people calls itself the Beijing Tongzhi Zhongxin  —   or the Beijing Comrade Center. Even Google has caught on. Enter the characters for tongzhi guanxi  —   literally “comrade relationship” —   into its translator, and it gives you “gay relationship. ” (Baidu, the dominant   search engine, by contrast, offers the literal translation.) Fan Popo, a gay rights activist and filmmaker based in Beijing, said there had been episodes in which Chinese criticized gay rights activists for appropriating the political term. For some younger Chinese, however, the word “comrade” offered a source of comfort for those who felt too ashamed to use the term “tongxinglian,” or homosexual, Mr. Fan said. “But now, people have really gotten used to it,” he said. “Even the   on the bus  —   the people who you would not really expect to know the modern lingo  —   don’t say ‘comrade’ anymore because they know what it means among young people. ” Nowadays, Chinese typically refer to one another as “mister,” “miss” or “madame. ” Strangers often address one another as “young miss,” “beautiful woman,” “handsome man” or “master. ” Within the party, only top leaders are typically referred to as “comrade. ” At the lower levels, “comrade” has been replaced by a grab bag of titles. In a commentary published last year, Study Times, a weekly party journal, railed against modern designations like “deputy secretary,” “boss,” “C. E. O. ,” “grandfather” and “brother. ” “These terms have not only destroyed the seriousness of democratic relations within the party,” the commentary read, “but they have also affected the relationship between the party and the masses as well as the overall image of the party. ” After a meeting last month of the Communist Party’s Central Committee, leaders issued a directive urging party members to eschew titles and honorifics in favor of the revolutionary throwback. The directive instructed that “party members must call each other ‘comrades. ’” Some political experts, however, voiced skepticism that the order would change much. “These days, everyone who joins the party does so to become an official and make money,” said Zhang Lifan, a writer and historian. “You can’t really call these people true comrades. ” There may also be an inherent contradiction. Last month’s Central Committee meeting  —   the same one that issued the order to party members to call one another comrade  —   had another, bigger announcement: “Comrade Xi Jinping” had been elevated to “core” leader, cementing his status as China’s central political strongman. “Power is power,” Mr. Zhang said. “You can say that all party members are comrades. But among all the comrades, there is still a core. ”",0
44291,UPDATE: TRANSGENDER TARGET BOYCOTT Reaches Boiling Point…Loses $4 BILLION In 30 Days…CEO Defends Dangerous Bathroom Position,"Note to Target CEO: When you endanger the safety of little girls and women in your stores, you re giving  placing a  target  on your back  a whole new meaning. Only two days ago in women s bathroom in Chicago, an 8 year old girl was choked by a man until she was unconscious. He proceeded to drag into a bathroom stall. Fortunately, her mother overheard her screams and was able to come to her rescue. Is this really the kind of America we want? Is Target ready to accept responsibility for crimes against women and children in their bathrooms and changing rooms?UPDATE: Target is facing a nationwide backlash for its support of transgender rights.More than 1.2 million people have signed a pledge to boycott the retailer after it announced last month that it would welcome transgender customers to use any bathroom or fitting room that matches their gender identity.Critics have been holding protests and demonstrations at stores across the country, and they are showing no signs of dying down.Many are demanding access to bathrooms of the opposite sex to support claims that  perverts  can now prey on children and women as a result of the policy.The boycotters  goal is to force Target to reverse its policy, or at least make the retailer suffer for it by spending their money elsewhere.  Breitbart NewsThe CEO of retail giant Target is zig-zagging between the many customers who are angered by his decision to open single-sex bathrooms to the other sex, the gender-identity progressives who pushed for the disastrous transgender policy, and the Wall Street stock-pickers who have chopped roughly $4.5 billion off the company s value. We re going to continue to embrace our belief in diversity and inclusion, just how important that is to our company, CEO Brian Cornell said in a May 11 appearance on CNBC s  Squawk Box  business show.  But we re also going to make sure our focus on safety is unwavering,  he added.To mollify the public angered by his removal of single-sex restrooms and changing rooms, the company will add family bathrooms to all of its stores, he said.We re committed over the next few months, to make sure every one of our stores has that option, because we want to make sure that our guests be welcomed in our stores. But if there s a question of safety, I can tell you and others, our focus on safety is unwavering, and we want to make sure we provide a welcoming environment for all our guests, one that s safe, one that s comfortable.But Cornell did not offer to return single-sex changing rooms, which is likely the most unnerving element in the company s new open-door, pro-transgender agenda.The company can t easily add family changing-rooms without using up scarce space in their retail stores   and can t reestablish single-sex changing-rooms without angering many progressive professionals in the media and fashion industries. Those progressives professionals would likely claim the company is unfairly  gender policing  its customers, even though transgender advocates say only 1 in every 300 Americans are transgender. Other estimates say the ratio is only 1 transgender for every 2,400 Americans.So Cornell tried to reassure and flatter progressives about the justice of his company s brand-damaging, revenue-reducing April 19 decision.  We took a stance,  Cornell said, as he suggested that single-sex bathrooms are just like a racist refusal to use African-Americans in commercial advertising in the 1960s.We ve had a long history embracing diversity and inclusion. A couple weeks ago, one of our team members sent me a note reminding me that if we went back to the mid-60s, our company was one of the very first to use African-American models in their advertising, and back then, it wasn t well received.In the company s initial April 19 statement, the store said,  we welcome transgender team members and [customer] guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity. The statement came as Americans were recognizing and rejecting the revolutionary political agenda behind the push for transgender status.Since April 19,  We had a lot of tough feedback. But sitting here today, we know we made the right decision,  Cornell insisted.That tough feedback includes a consumer boycott that now has 1.2 million supporters, much damage to the company s brand, and a massive sell-off on Wall Street that has chopped the company s share price from almost $84 on April 19 to $75.70 on May 11.That s a loss of $8.30 per share, or 10 percent, or almost $5 billion since April 19. Of course, some part of that loss is due to President Barack Obama s weak economy   but no company is helped by many management decisions that anger so many customers. Via: Breitbart News",1
18956,House will not reach healthcare deal before two-week break,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Deep divisions cut short Republican hopes for a quick revival of Obamacare replacement legislation on Wednesday, as Congress prepared to leave town for a two-week recess without a deal to end party infighting. “We are going to go home tomorrow without a deal,” Congressman Chris Collins, a Republican moderate in the U.S. House of Representatives, told reporters.   A White House ally, Collins said days of negotiations have broken down over conservative demands to allow states to waive popular Obamacare policies that protect sick people from price discrimination and allow young adults to stay on their parents’ healthcare plans until age 26. He said the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus was “moving the goal posts” for negotiations, risking potential support from moderate Republicans.   Both sides of the debate have warned that the Republican push for healthcare reform, one of President Donald Trump’s top campaign promises, could lose momentum if lawmakers left this week without a deal to bridge fissures that led to the legislation’s failure on March 24, when House Speaker Paul Ryan canceled a vote. Earlier on Wednesday, Heritage Action Chief Executive Mike Needham told reporters his conservative group was looking at ways to target House moderates known as the Tuesday Group, with attack ads in their districts and other tactics. But Ryan told a forum that the discussions had been “very productive” and emphasized that Republican leaders have not set a deadline for agreement. “We can keep working this for weeks now,” Ryan said. “We’ve got time to figure this out.”    Republicans have been railing against President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act since its enactment in 2010. On Tuesday, some Republican lawmakers expressed hope the Trump White House would unveil a healthcare bill. Some conservatives said a vote by the House was possible this week.  The legislation has not yet emerged, despite talks with Republican lawmakers led by Vice President Mike Pence. A House Republican leadership aide said on Wednesday that plans remained on track for the divided chamber to begin a more than two-week recess by mid-afternoon on Thursday. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, late on Tuesday said, “There’s a concern on my part that if we’re making real progress, that going home sends the wrong message.”  Meadows told reporters on Wednesday he had not yet heard from the White House about timing of the next negotiation session. Still, the negotiations will allow lawmakers to return to their home districts and tell voters they are trying to deliver on a campaign promise that helped them win election. In an interview with Axios and NBC television, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Republicans will produce a healthcare bill, but did not provide a timetable. Late on Tuesday, following a closed-door meeting with House Republicans, Pence told reporters there was “good talk, good progress” toward a bill. He did not elaborate. Republican lawmakers have said efforts are focused on maintaining Obamacare’s essential health benefits, such as mental health coverage and maternity care. But states could apply for waivers if they could improve coverage and reduce costs. If major portions of Obamacare are repealed, there were discussions of creating a “backstop” so premiums do not spike for people with chronic illnesses in high-risk insurance pools. ",0
69022,Steven Mnuchin: ’Regulation Is Killing Community Banks’ - Breitbart,"The highlight of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s confirmation hearing so far was his rousing defense of community banks against overbearing federal regulations. [“Regulation is killing community banks,” he declared, and if the process is not reversed, we could “end up in a world where we have four big banks in this country. ” He went on to offer examples of how regulations enacted after the 2008 financial crisis had some unexpected negative consequences.   Mnuchin ran through a list of regulatory agencies  —   “the OCC, the FDIC, Consumer Protection Bureau, the Federal Reserve” —   and noted that “in certain cases, there is overlapping regulation. ” “My biggest concern, and I fully support regulation for banks with FDIC insurance, but my biggest concern is that this regulation is killing community banks,” he said. “We’re losing the community banking business. We’re losing the ability for small and   banks to make good loans to small and   businesses in the community, where they understand those credit risks better than anybody else. ” “I think that we all appreciate the engine of growth is with small and   businesses. In my role at FSOC, in working with the different regulators, I would make sure that we did what we could to have proper regulation, but eliminate overlap, as well as make sure that the banks are lending to small and   businesses, and we don’t end up with a world where we only have four big banks in this country,” Mnuchin said. He was referring to his prospective chairmanship of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a new regulatory body created by the   regulations to decide which private institutions are vital to the stability of the U. S. financial system, and so merit enhanced federal oversight. Senator Mike Crapo ( ) noted the importance of Mnuchin’s role within FSOC, which he criticized as “heavily focusing on some of its statutory mandates while ignoring others” since its inception.  Crapo highlighted the statutory mandate to “advise Congress and make recommendation in such areas that will enhance the integrity, efficiency, competitiveness, and stability of U. S. financial markets. ” “To date, frankly, I’m not aware of FSOC fulfilling that role,” he said. “We don’t get a lot of advice from FSOC. We get a lot of directive in the country. Will you pledge, as the chairperson of FSOC, that you will ensure that the council considers ways to make the U. S. financial markets more efficient, and then advise and work with Congress to achieve those outcomes?” “I absolutely will, Senator,” Mnuchin replied. “Let me just comment on, for instance, the Volcker Rule as an example. I do support the Volcker Rule. I think the concept of proprietary trading does not belong in banks with FDIC insurance. ”  The Volcker Rule is another artifact of the   legislation, which as Mnuchin indicated limits bank ownership of hedge funds and private equity funds. In essence, it prevents banks from using the money they’re holding for investments that benefit the bank instead of its customers, which is the sort of activity that contributed to the immense losses in the 2008 financial crisis. “The Federal Reserve just put out its own report that the Volcker Rule has completely limited liquidity in many markets,” Mnuchin continued. “The Federal Reserve is concerned that the interpretation of the Volcker Rule doesn’t allow banks to create enough liquidity for customers. So that’s something I would absolutely want to look at. ”",0
12756,Lockheed CEO tells Trump she will work to drive down cost of F-35,"(Reuters) - The chief executive of Lockheed Martin Corp told President-elect Donald Trump on Friday that she was committed to driving down the cost of the company’s F-35 fighter jet, a day after Trump took aim at the cost of the F-35 in a Twitter post. CEO Marillyn Hewson said she spoke with Trump on Friday afternoon and assured him that she had heard his message “loud and clear” about reducing the cost of the F-35. Trump, in a tweet posted late on Thursday, suggested that an older aircraft made by rival aerospace company Boeing Co could offer a cheaper alternative to the F-35.  “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Trump said. Hewson, in a statement posted on Twitter, said she had had “a very good conversation” with Trump on Friday. “I gave him my personal commitment to drive the cost down aggressively,” she said in the statement. Lockheed shares closed down 1.3 percent on Friday, nearing their lowest levels since the Nov. 8 election. They were the biggest drag on a basket of defense-related stocks. Boeing’s stock ended near the unchanged mark. Trump had met with the chief executives of both Lockheed and Boeing on Wednesday. Boeing’s F-18 is an older generation aircraft that lacks the stealth capabilities of the F-35.  One U.S. official said it was impossible to tell what Trump meant by his tweet, given the importance of stealth technology as a way to counter advanced defenses of near-peer states, like Russia or China. “Somebody needs to ask Donald Trump how he’s going to be able to confront China without aircraft capable of penetrating anti-access and area denial systems, including air defenses,” the official said. Most defense analysts do not consider the two jets as comparable aircraft.  “Impractical if not irrational,” Richard Safran, a defense analyst at Buckingham Research, said by email. “First, the F/A-18 is a carrier-based naval fighter. Certainly it could not meet the U.S. Marine Corps need for vertical lift. It would not be suitable for the Air Force either - the extra weight of a carrier fighter makes it less than ideal for the Air Force.” “Unless the rules of physics have changed, you cannot make a non-stealthy, two-engined, carrier-based aircraft from the 1980s into a single-engine, multi-role stealthy fighter from the 2000s,” Vertical Research Partners analysts wrote in a note on Friday. Still, Trump’s dissatisfaction with the program, which has been dogged by problems while costs have escalated to an estimated $379 billion, is a clear risk for Lockheed. The F-35 program is a critical sales generator for the company, accounting for 20 percent of last year’s total revenue of $46.1 billion. The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said on Thursday in an email that the company was committed to providing the capability and affordability to meet national security needs. On Wednesday, Trump met the CEOs of Lockheed and Boeing at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told reporters there that he had guaranteed costs would not get out of control for a replacement to Air Force One, the presidential plane, another project Trump calls too expensive.     Trump told reporters he wanted to cut the F-35 program’s costs.  Trump’s jockeying for leverage via his Twitter account is likely to be a hurdle for all U.S. defense contractors, Roman Schweizer, aerospace and defense analyst at Cowen & Co, wrote in a client note on Thursday. Trump unleashed his tirade about the hefty cost for U.S. aircraft earlier this month, first lashing out at Boeing over the cost of replacement Air Force One presidential planes and days later at Lockheed over the F-35. Since Trump’s first tweet about Air Force One on Dec. 6, Lockheed shares have slumped around 6.4 percent, costing its shareholders collectively about $5 billion in lost market value.  “We have no idea how this plays out but believe ‘Twitter risk’ for defense companies could be a significant issue over the next four years,” Cowen’s Schweizer wrote. “This is Lockheed Martin’s time in the barrel.” ",0
53024,Will Trump Swallow the G.O.P. Whole? - The New York Times,"Every week or so during the spring, I met with Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the party headquarters on Capitol Hill. We fell into a familiar routine. I would enter his office, usually chaperoned by Sean Spicer, the R. N. C. ’s chief strategist and head of communications. Priebus has a healthy appreciation for gallows humor, which is not a bad thing for an R. N. C. chairman these days. “I haven’t started pouring Baileys in my cereal yet,” he says often enough that it has become a signature line. I would regularly break the ice with something sarcastic, like asking Priebus how his party’s Hispanic outreach program was going on the morning after the committee’s head of Hispanic outreach resigned rather than work another day for Donald Trump’s election. “The scent of party unity is in the air,” I said in May when Paul Ryan reported that he was “not there yet” on supporting Trump. “No, that’s incense,” Priebus said, pointing out that he had been burning some behind his desk. As suits a man occupying what might be the toughest political job in America, Priebus does his best to stay availed of serene distractions. He plays jazz piano at home late at night and gazes into the   saltwater fish tank that he keeps next to his desk. “You see that big eel?” Priebus asked one day, pointing out a black slithery creature on the bottom, before noting others. “That’s a yellow tang, hippo tang, a spotted puffer. There’s an anemone. An urchin. An orange clown fish. ” He took a hunk of shrimp from a refrigerator and dangled it with a set of tongs into the water. A race to the bottom ensued as bits fell away and the fish vied for pieces of flesh. It was difficult to look away from the feeding frenzy. The big orange clown fish flailed at front and center. I asked Priebus if it reminded him of anyone. “That’s not funny,” he said with something between a slight grunt and chuckle. No matter how much Trump has roiled the Republican water, it remained Priebus’s job to carry it. The presumed Republican nominee appears on many days to be at open war with the party that is about to nominate him. The entire campaign, meanwhile, has been a proxy battle for the proverbial “soul of the party” that has been escalating between the G. O. P. ’s populist grass roots (captured by Trump) and “party leaders” (embodied by Priebus, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell). Is the G. O. P. now the “party of Trump”? Priebus bristles when people ask him this  —   or taunt him. I asked Priebus some variation on this question during each of my visits. “Donald Trump is Donald Trump,” Priebus says. “And the party is the party. ” “Priebus” is a German name, pronounced like the Toyota Prius with a “b” stuck in the middle. Reince (short for Reinhold, rhymes with “pints”) is 44 but has an  ’s vibe. He is often underslept, has the beginnings of jowls and tiny goose pimples clustered under his eyes like those on the belly of a toad. He speaks in the slow and slightly   manner of an adolescent whose parents are always hassling him about the nightmare house guest. The Trump issue, in other words. It’s never far from anything, and really, these days, what else is there? Plenty, Priebus kept trying to convince me. The Republican Party had its own distinct identity and principles and points of pride. It controls both chambers of Congress and holds more federal and statewide seats than at any time since 1900, he said. What keeps eluding Republicans is the White House. They have lost the popular vote in five of the last six national elections. “Cultural elections,” Priebus calls them  —   “the big ones. ” A chief reason for this is that many voters dismiss Republicans as being culturally and demographically stuck in 1900. It was Priebus who commissioned and endorsed the findings of the G. O. P. “autopsy” after Mitt Romney’s defeat in 2012. Formally christened as the “Growth and Opportunity Project,” the report warned that the G. O. P. was “increasingly marginalizing itself” to a point where it would be “increasingly difficult for Republicans to win another presidential election in the near future. ” That is, the report concluded, unless the party expanded its aging white base to include more immigrants, ethnic minorities and women, precisely the groups the next likely   has so splendidly repelled. Priebus refers to himself as a “party guy. ” He spent much of his youth in Kenosha, Wis. organizing pizza parties for Republican volunteers, putting up yard signs and listening to Newt Gingrich speeches on cassettes in his car  —     things. His first date with his future wife included a trip to a Republican Lincoln Day dinner, an evening sexed up by the presence of two Republican congressmen: James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and Henry Hyde of Illinois. Being a “party guy” can come off sounding a little   nerdy, like being a   guy. But Priebus speaks of this identity with sincere pride, and his allegiance is clear: to “the party,” not any one nominee. Still, our meetings sometimes took on the feel of therapy sessions, with Priebus playing the role of the betrayed spouse trying to convince me that his tormentor really could change. Trump would soon be “pivoting” into a more “presidential” mode, Priebus kept promising. But after a while it became clear that Trump’s outrages would continue unabated. Within the space of a few weeks, he suggested that Bill Clinton had committed rape and (along with Hillary) might have killed his former aide Vince Foster and that Ted Cruz’s father might have associated with Lee Harvey Oswald and that Mitt Romney walked like a penguin and. . .. Priebus pretty much stopped bothering with “presidential. ” On this particular day, cable news was    with stories: the surfacing of an audio tape of someone sounding a lot like Trump claiming to be a Trump “spokesman” the discovery of a Facebook post from Trump’s longtime butler calling for President Obama to be killed and news that the Trump campaign had selected a white nationalist leader to be a California delegate (the delegate wound up resigning). Priebus eventually pivoted to Trump’s supposed “authenticity. ” Yes, “authenticity” was a better word, more latitude. He settled on the idea that Trump was a “unique” candidate who had created a new standard for what a politician could say and get away with. “He’s carved out this idea that he’s this earthquake in a box,” Priebus says. Priebus was saying in effect that it would be possible to build a wall around Donald Trump and not have the G. O. P. pay for it. Trump did not define its values in the long term, even if he might temporarily defile them. “We’re the party of the ‘open door,’’u2009” Priebus told me, as he often does. Not big, beautiful walls. For a while this spring, it seemed possible to contain the earthquake. Trump showed flickering signs of “maturing” as a candidate, and Republicans seemed willing to “support the nominee,” if not endorse him. The “normalization” of Donald Trump became a media watchword, the idea that his daily affronts could be integrated into the routine paces of a quadrennial exercise. Formerly hostile primary opponents like Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Bobby Jindal and Rick Perry all at various points said they would support Trump or were at least no longer (in Rubio’s case) deriding him as a “fraud,” “con man” and “lunatic” or (in Graham’s) a “  xenophobic, religious bigot” or (in Jindal’s) a “madman who must be stopped” or (in Perry’s) a “barking carnival act. ” I imagined Trump laughing at how easy it was to get Republicans to submit to him after he had savaged so many of them during the primaries. Actually there was no need to imagine because Trump was doing exactly that. “I’ve never seen people able to pivot like politicians,” he said at a rally in California in late May while boasting of his support from Perry. In an interview, I asked Trump if it was harder to flip politicians or the real estate people he has dealt with over the years. His smirk was audible over the phone. “Well, I’m not referring to any politicians in particular, but I’ve said many times that businesspeople are much tougher,” Trump said. “Politicians tend to be much more deceptive and deceiving and more willing to break a deal. But they are not as tough. ” Priebus, meanwhile, kept working the phones, trying to coax   Republicans back to the party line and persuade  —   beg  —   Trump to lay off the elected Republicans he kept dumping on. “I have encouraged him to constantly offer grace to people that he doesn’t think are deserving of grace,” Priebus said. Trump, in turn, calls Priebus “Mr. Switzerland” and speaks well of him. “Reince is a peacemaker, a very good person for getting people together,” he said. Trump was calling me from his limo after a rally in Anaheim, Calif. He was in the midst of an intrapartisan grudge tour of the American West, during which he disparaged, among other Republicans, Jeb Bush, the South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley, and the New Mexico governor, Susana Martinez, who is one of the   Hispanic elected officials in the G. O. P. He also reiterated that Romney was a “loser” and a “choker” and for good measure boasted that “I have a store that’s worth more money than he is. ” Priebus’s mother is Greek, which he says trains him for dealing with whatever the Greek word for mishegas is. “Ever see ‘My Big Fat Greek Wedding’?” he asked. “That’s my family, that’s my life. The arguing starts at 7:30 in the morning, everyone’s in each other’s business. It was good family chaos. ” I asked if what the G. O. P. was going through now was “good family chaos. ” “It depends how it turns out,” he said. At this point in the    calendar four and eight years ago, Romney and John McCain had built massive campaign operations and   networks that were orders of magnitude larger than Trump’s. They had accumulated armies of elected officials promoting them and were diligently making peace with vanquished opponents and paying courtesy calls to party dignitaries and congressional leaders in the name of “unity. ” The period between the end of the primaries and the start of the conventions is typically one of consolidation,   harvesting and turning full attention to the   opponent  —   all of which Trump has succeeded in achieving the   opposite of. Trump would of course be the first to point out that both McCain and Romney lost and that he has been doubted at every step of his campaign. But the degree to which he seems unconcerned with his pariah status among name Republicans remains a key feature of his pursuit. To a comical extent, top Republicans willed themselves invisible when I reached out to them for this article, fearing, not incorrectly, that the conversation would turn to Trump. This included some of the most typically quotable Republicans, including former Trump challengers like Graham (“He’s sorta had his fill talking about Trump,” a spokesman emailed) Perry (“Thanks for thinking of him”) and Ted Cruz (“Not great timing on our end”) the previous nominee Mitt Romney (“You are kind to think of me,” he wrote) Trump stalwarts like Chris Christie (“We are going to take a pass this time”)   Republican governors like Charlie Baker of Massachusetts (“The governor won’t be available”) and senators like Mike Lee, of Utah (“Senator Lee would love to talk to you about the state of the G. O. P. and conservatism in general. We are free anytime after Nov 8. ”). I tried Rubio, who has undergone more public agony than perhaps anyone about Trump. Rubio looks nauseated whenever someone asks him about the man he called “the most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency” but who later said he would be “honored” to speak for at the Republican convention before clarifying that if he did speak, he would only “speak about things I believe in, not somebody else’s platform. ” Rubio also holds the astonishing position of saying he’ll vote for someone he has previously declared unfit to hold the American nuclear codes. You envision him under a mushroom cloud, assuring his kids that it could be even worse  —   at least he didn’t vote for Clinton. There’s a palpable weariness among Republicans, and it’s still only June. Every day, it’s something else. “What it does is suck all the oxygen out of the chamber,” Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, told me. “I’m trying to do my job as a senator, which does not end because we have a contentious and bizarre presidential candidate. ” Trump, after accumulating enough delegates to win the nomination with almost no visible operation or recognizable strategy, has only nominally scaled his campaign beyond where it was a few months ago. There is barely any   or field apparatus to speak of, and Trump has outsourced a great deal of the   of an enormous   campaign to the overtasked R. N. C. Priebus has won praise for revamping the   data and field infrastructure that he inherited from his embattled predecessor, Michael Steele, in 2011. But no national committee in recent memory has been called upon to pick up as much operational slack in a general election. I asked Priebus if he was frustrated that so much has been thrown into the R. N. C. ’s lap. “It’s more frustrating for us when a campaign comes in and layers over our field staff,” is how he spun it. In addition to celebrating the presidential nominee, national conventions are a showcase for party eminences, rising stars and elected officials. Not so here. The last nominee, Romney, and two living former presidents, George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, have said they are not supporting Trump or will not campaign for him. McCain has said he would be skipping the convention and is pursuing his senate   in Arizona with characteristically gritted teeth: the familiar “it pains me to do this” routine. Three of the top five   in the primaries  —   Cruz, Jeb Bush and the Ohio governor John Kasich  —   have either made no commitment to support Trump or, in Bush’s case, said definitively he would not support him. A fourth, Rubio, in addition to his prolonged and winding agony over Trump, has said he does “not want to be considered” as Trump’s running mate. This is a popular distancing trick doubling as a nifty   among reluctant Trump endorsers. “To the members of the press who are asking, while I am flattered to be mentioned,” Nikki Haley said, “my plate is full, and I am not interested in serving as vice president. ” (For the record, Trump finds these expressions annoying. “They were never asked,” Trump told me. “I don’t like it when they do that, because it’s very dishonest. If they’ve taken themselves out, it means they’re not being asked. ”) There is a distinct sense among leading Republicans that if you take proper precautions  —      —   it’s possible to avoid contagion. Ryan agreed to be interviewed for a Father’s Day feature in People Magazine but only on the condition that no Trump questions be asked. Trump seems to fundamentally welcome the party’s revulsion. As Ryan wavered over supporting him, Trump was privately saying that Ryan’s rejection might actually help him, that he was just the kind of political lifer whom Trump positioned his campaign against. His   director (and a former caddie) Dan Scavino Jr. actually went public with this, tweeting out a link to a column in Breitbart headlined, “Paul Ryan Is the Reason the G. O. P. Is Losing America. ” While Ryan is trying to refashion and sell the G. O. P. as a party of innovation and heart, Trump is a creature of mouth and gut and other   drivers. They can try to operate in parallel G. O. P. universes, but the two styles are often in obvious conflict. On the sunny morning of June 7 in Washington, Ryan and a group of seven House colleagues visited the mostly black neighborhood Anacostia to highlight a central idea of Ryan’s agenda. After a meeting at a residential   center, the representatives took turns giving testimonials on why Republican policies  —   lower taxes, entitlement reform, less regulation  —   would better address the intractable problems of urban poverty. This was Ryan at his most earnest and  . His concern for the urban poor derives heavily from his intellectual mentor, Jack Kemp, the former Republican congressman, housing secretary and patron saint of     conservatism. Poverty is the first item of Ryan’s   policy plan. He spoke at a lectern, surrounded by community leaders, and then invited questions from the press. Did Ryan have any regrets about endorsing Trump? “I told you,” Ryan said, smiling, turning to one of his hosts. The first six or so questions were about Trump. He was then in the midst of a furor over his repeated claims that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the   jurist presiding in a civil case against Trump University, could not rule fairly because he was “Mexican. ” Ryan was blunt on the Curiel matter. “Claiming a person can’t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment,” he said. That was the headline. Ryan expressed great frustration that such comments by Trump “undercut these things,” meaning this   event. When we spoke, Ryan was most eager to discuss Priebus, his old friend and fellow Wisconsinite. Along with the   governor, Scott Walker, the trio form a formidable G. O. P. axis of cheese heads. I asked Ryan how he, as the   elected Republican, would distinguish his mission as a party leader from Priebus’s. “I see my role as helping to define the standard, which are the issues,” Ryan told me. Priebus’s role is building the party’s apparatus to be ready for the  . “Reince is basically being the adult in calming the situation,” he added. “He is protecting that   process. Reince is protecting that from being disfigured or hijacked. ” Ryan views himself as a guardian of conservative “ideas. ” “Ideas” is one of those fetish words, popular among ambitious young pols (conservative   are constantly dropping Kemp’s name). As the speaker of the Florida House, Rubio published a book in 2006 of “100 innovative ideas” and spoke about his love of ideas during his presidential campaign, before he started making   jokes about Trump. Bobby Jindal, the Louisiana governor who was then considered one of the   innovators of the party, warned after Romney’s defeat in 2012 that the G. O. P. must stop being “the stupid party” and urged fellow Republicans to talk “like adults” and swear off “offensive and bizarre” rhetoric. He then embarked on a presidential campaign in which his most memorable “idea” was suggesting that Trump “looks like he’s got a squirrel sitting on his head. ” (Jindal dropped out in November Trump barely bothered to insult him.) Jindal’s “stupid party” remark reflected a concern among idea conservatives that was marinating well before Trump came along: that the Republican Party has taken on an increasingly   bent. There has been a strong populist allergy to elitism within the G. O. P. coalition for a long time. But Sarah Palin’s emergence as the   nominee in 2008 and subsequent tenure as a party celebrity was a benchmark. Lesser imitators like Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain took turns as Republican   in 2012. Trump made his name as a national political figure in 2011 and 2012 with his flamboyant campaign to prove that Obama was not born in the United States, an   notion that was especially offensive to  . Four years later, the leader of what many Republicans had hoped was a nativist fringe movement is the party’s presumed nominee. Ryan believed that he and fellow   in Congress could preserve the party’s substantive core. This would be the laboratory from which he could remake the party’s conservative identity while attracting new Republicans, including young and minority voters. “I have to protect conservatism from being disfigured,” Ryan told me. His focus, he said, is on “ideas, temperament and the future of conservatism. ” Ryan has little confidence that Trump cares at all about his ideas, possessed that temperament or had thought at all about the future of conservatism. Trump almost never talks about “ideas,” unless you count blustery promises to “build a wall and make Mexico pay for it,” end lousy trade deals and “win” again. When, after considerable public hesitation, Ryan finally did say he would “vote for” Trump, he wrote a column in a newspaper in Janesville, Wis. reiterating his view that “politics can be a battle of ideas, not insults” and that “if we’re going to unite, it has to be over ideas. ” He said he had become convinced that Trump “would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws. ” What Trump had going for him more than anything, in Ryan’s eyes, was his willingness to outsource the conservative “idea” architecture of his administration to Ryan and   Republicans in the same way that he’s farming out much of his   campaign to the R. N. C. Even so, there’s no avoiding that Trump has over the last year been the ubiquitous voice of the G. O. P. to most voters, many of them new ones. He can cut a problematic image, to say the least. (In a June 15 Bloomberg poll, just 32 percent of Americans view the Republican Party favorably, the lowest figure since the survey’s 2009 inception.) Priebus and Ryan were relatively powerless during the primaries as Trump undertook his systematic disfiguring of the R. N. C. ’s plans for a more inclusive party. Last summer, during the relatively innocent months of Trump’s campaign, Priebus called and urged him to tone down his remarks (about “Mexican rapists,” for example). Trump scoffed at the idea that such a puny figure, a party guy, would ever try such a thing. “We’re not dealing with a   Army general,” Trump said. Priebus paid a debasing house call to Trump Tower last fall to accompany Trump as he signed a loyalty pledge to the eventual nominee. He listened this spring to Trump predict “riots” in Cleveland and complain about the “rigged” system that might deny him his rightful nomination. (“Give us all a break,” Priebus tweeted at one point.) He has endured an outpouring from a gallery of   who are urging the R. N. C. to take extraordinary measures and disavow its extraordinary nominee. “If Priebus ends up blessing the Trump nomination,” wrote the Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson, the head White House speechwriter for George W. Bush, “it would turn the sins of Trump into the sins of the G. O. P. And Priebus would go down as the head of the party who squandered the legacy of Lincoln, the legacy of Reagan, in a squalid and hopeless political effort. ” Priebus is not a man for extraordinary measures. He is an organization man in a time of disruption, runaway   and selfie campaigns. Party guys go along. It’s not always a fair fight. Political parties have seen better days in America. They are like many big and traditional institutions that way: the government, the church, among others. Signing on with the Donkeys and Elephants would seem a tired construct in a disintermediated culture of free agents and personal brand customization. Identities have replaced affiliations. In the course of reporting this article, I asked many Republicans of varied perspective why a young person today should consider joining a major political party. The question elicited sighs and head shakes, as if I were asking them why a millennial would join a Kiwanis Club, except that Kiwanis Clubs aren’t actively being resisted the way the Democratic and Republican parties are. Based on data from a 2014 Pew survey, 39 percent of the electorate identify as independents, compared with 32 percent as Democrats and 23 percent as Republicans (that’s the highest proportion of independents in nearly eight decades of surveys despite the fact that the country remains heavily partisan). It’s certainly worth pointing out that people have been predicting the death of the   system in America for years and also the demise of individual parties at various low points. The G. O. P. was supposedly terminal after Barry Goldwater’s landslide defeat of 1964, as were the Democrats following the rout of George McGovern in 1972 each party came back to win the White House four years later. Priebus, not surprisingly, is a defender of the party status quo. “The reality is, there’s two doors that people can walk through in this country,” he told me. “It’s not Italy. We don’t have 12 different parties where everyone can fit into their exact box. ” Still, the culture and speed of technological change has fueled an accelerated shift in how voters engage with and perceive political institutions and politicians. When I asked Trump the “why join a party?” question, he said, “I think the whole system is changing. ” His toggling between parties over the years has been well documented. Likewise, his embrace of atypical Republican positions during the primaries  —   his support for some aspects of Planned Parenthood  —   did nothing to thwart his nomination. It would indicate that voters might not be as wedded to the assumed conservative orthodoxies as G. O. P. leaders might think. “You have people who are socially conservative and fiscally nonconservative and vice versa,” Trump told me. “You have so many different permutations now. ” Trump’s embrace of this à la carte approach comports to a sensibility of voters’ choosing between models of disruption rather than a singular ideology. In a sense, disruption in and of itself has become an ideology. Whoever swings the biggest wrecking ball wins. “Washington is so broken and needs to be disrupted, and a lot of what could happen in this disruption would be good,” said Ben Sasse, a freshman Republican senator from Nebraska. “Unfortunately, it has to be someone who takes seriously the stewarding of a whole nation. And who cares about facts. And who is trustworthy. ” Sasse was pointedly not talking about Trump. He has said that he could not support him as his party nominee. He would not be voting for Clinton either. “There are Dumpster fires in my town more popular than these two ‘leaders,’’u2009” he wrote in a Facebook post in which he predicted the imminent breakup of both parties. He was harsher on Trump. Everywhere he goes in Nebraska, Sasse told me, people ask him for advice. “People say: ‘I’m distraught. I’m opposed to everything Hillary Clinton stands for, and yet I think I have to vote for her. How do you make sense of this? What should I do? ’’u2009” he said. “These are young evangelical women, teary sometimes. They say, ‘I can never tell my kids I voted for that man. ’’u2009” Sasse, who is 44, became an instant luminary of the   Never Trump movement after he unloaded on Trump. He is mostly avoiding interviews, though in a classic bit of politician   took this as an opportunity to share with me that “I’ve turned down something like 45 Sunday shows in a row. ” I asked Sasse if America’s fascination with celebrity might help explain the rise of Trump. No, he said. “There is such crisis of shared vision for what America means right now,” Sasse, a   former college president and business consultant, said. “People desperately seek shallower pop culture as a form of escape rather than finding actual meaning. ” For politics to be satisfying, it requires deeper ideals. And to partake of it as just another celebrity snack food leads a citizen to feel, after a while, “like you’ve eaten a   of cotton candy. ” In a tweet from early May, Sasse tried to nudge the former senator Tom Coburn into making a   bid. Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican and   physician, left the Senate in 2015 after spending his career  —   six years in the House, 10 in the Senate  —   as one of Washington’s proudest conservative mavericks and procedural troublemakers. Sasse told me that Coburn is one of his political idols. He also mentioned Paul Ryan. “If Tom Coburn and Paul Ryan have a baby,” Sasse said, “I’m their hideous offspring. ” All things being equal, Coburn would welcome having a superdisrupter in Washington. He has never been a party guy. “I don’t think it really matters, the parties,” Coburn, now retired and living in Tulsa, said. But Trump has been “repulsive to me,” he said, adding that Trump’s ability to win a party nomination “kind of fits with the modern social decline of America. ” I asked Coburn what Trump’s nomination signaled about the state of G. O. P. He was characteristically glib, apocalyptic and idealistic. “Either Trump is going to totally destroy the Republican Party,” Coburn said. “Or in the aftermath of him possibly losing an election, we’re going to rebuild it stronger than ever. ” The    option is predicated on Trump’s losing. Several Republicans I spoke to seemed to hope for this, if not explicitly. It is politically fraught, obviously, to say they will not support their party’s presidential nominee. But based on my discussions, I’m willing to bet a good portion of the elected Republicans who claim minimal allegiance to “the nominee” will wind up voting for Clinton in the privacy of their voting booths while rooting for Trump’s complete humiliation. “We’re just going to have to swallow it,” said Mark Salter, the longtime chief of staff and confidant of John McCain. “He’s just unfit for the office,” referring to Trump. As for Clinton, he said, “I mean, the worst thing you can say about her is, she’s kind of a hack. ” Ed Rogers, a Republican lobbyist and veteran of the Reagan and George H. W. Bush White Houses, calls himself a “not yet Republican,” meaning he is “not yet” ready to support Trump and has in fact moved in the opposite direction since Trump clinched the nomination last month. Rogers, a longtime business partner of the former Mississippi governor and R. N. C. chairman Haley Barbour, acknowledged that the Republicans tend to exaggerate Clinton’s flaws as a trade prerogative. “The Clintons have never been the demons ideologically that we’ve made them out to be,” Rogers told me. “From a character standpoint, they’re pretty bad, but Hillary isn’t the frightening offensive character that Trump is. ” If   Republicans rebelled against the “establishment” in the primaries, Trump has provided the establishment with mounting ammunition to fight back in the 11th hour. The first half of June has been a running train wreck for Trump, beginning with his crusade against Judge Curiel. Trump has been provoking increasing alarm among Republicans at the moment he should be proving himself nominally “presidential. ” The Republican senator Mark Kirk of Illinois announced that he could no longer support Trump in the aftermath of Curiel (“I think he’s too bigoted and racist for the Land of Lincoln”) Lindsey Graham did the same and urged other Republicans backing Trump to rescind their endorsements. Top Republicans voiced widespread opposition   to Trump’s reiterated calls for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. Trump in turn called party leaders “weak” and pounded them for not falling in line behind him. “Just please be quiet, don’t talk,” he railed at them at a June 15 rally in Atlanta. “We have to have our Republicans either stick together or let me do it by myself,” Trump said. “I’ll do very well. ” He would be banking on the   system being sufficiently hobbled that allegiance to him would prevail over partisan loyalty. Republicans wouldn’t hold it against Trump that he’s anathema to their establishment while Democrats would feel no loyalty to their traditional home team, let alone to Hillary Clinton. Trump appeared at this moment prepared to begin an independent   campaign under the nominal banner of the Republican Party, while using their abundant resources. This looked more like a jail break than a pivot. The second week of June was shaping up as another one of those “Baileys in my cereal” stretches for Reince Priebus. We were two days past the mass shooting in Orlando, a horrific event that moved Trump to tweet immediate thanks to all those who sent him “congrats” for predicting it. He also called on Obama to resign and later seemed to suggest that the president might have even been complicit in the tragedy. This invited swift repudiations from Republicans and Democrats, including a furious Obama, whose presidential stature seems to grow the longer Trump dominates news cycles. Obama’s net   rating has risen nearly 20 points since Trump became the G. O. P.   and the party’s inescapable face last summer. Priebus spent the weekend in Utah at an annual “ideas” gathering that Mitt Romney hosts for Republican luminaries, donors and business leaders. In a normal year, this would serve as a Republican unity confab before the convention: party bonding in the mountains. But this year’s edition was more of a rock slide. It convened a huddle of the Never Trumps, disaffected    and increasingly skittish party notables like Ryan and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee. Romney set the tone for the weekend when he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN that Trump in the White House could “change the character of the generations of Americans that are following” and might result in “  racism,” “  misogyny” and “  bigotry. ” In a    session with Ryan, the   chief executive Meg Whitman, who was the G. O. P. nominee for governor of California in 2010, questioned how Ryan could endorse such an appalling figure. She placed Trump in the company of Hitler and Mussolini. Romney appeared to tear up at one point, according to an account in Politico. “Seeing this just breaks your heart,” he said. Priebus played the good party soldier. “Respect Mitt and differences but couldn’t disagree more,” he tweeted at Romney after his remarks. “Let’s stop this and unify. ” Priebus told Trump opponents at the retreat that Trump would win “with or without their help. ” He conveyed the exasperation of a substitute teacher being pelted with flying erasers. In almost every visit, Priebus and I had engaged in some variation on the same discussion. I kept asking him: “Whose party is this anyway? Who gets to define the G. O. P. ?” “It’s the party’s party,” he always answered. “The party defines the party. ” Convention delegates write the platform that lays out the party’s tenets. Trump can’t really change those: It’s a common refrain these days among   Republicans. “Trump is not going to change the institution,” the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, told Politico last month, referring to the G. O. P. “He’s not going to change the basic philosophy of the party. ” Priebus and others might try to shape Trump’s behavior. They talk every day, Priebus and Trump. And tens of millions of people are having their impressions formed, shaped or solidified about today’s Republican Party by watching Donald Trump. They will vote for or against him in droves, not based on anything they read in the platform, whose readership probably amounts to less than 1 percent of Trump’s Twitter following. As I waited for Priebus in the lobby of the R. N. C. I noticed a tweet from an Associated Press reporter saying that Lamar Alexander, a Republican senator, had just suggested Trump might not be the surefire nominee after all. “We do not have a nominee until after the convention,” Alexander said. “That’s what you say,” Alexander added in response to a reminder that Trump was in fact the “presumptive nominee. ” It would seem ridiculously late in the process to be haggling over modifiers, at least it would be in a mythical normal year. When I walked into Priebus’s office, he sat on his couch and soldiered forth like a good party guy. If Ryan and McConnell tried to remain boxed off from the earthquake, Priebus occupied another shelter, constructed of   armor, alternate reality and denial. “I’m feeling good about things,” Priebus told me. His voice was flat and deliberate,   mode. It was hard to resist a few pokes at the organization man. How’s that Trump pivot working out? “I think it’s a work in progress,” Priebus said. He was trying to be upbeat. “I have Hillary Clinton on the other side,” he said, clinging to her as a lifeline. He was hoarse. I noticed him fiddling with a drink coaster. The coaster bore a cartoon rendition, sure enough, of Donald Trump: the only physical likeness I noticed anywhere in the building. Priebus had swiped a couple of these coasters from the bar at the   Hotel and found them amusing. He set them on a side table in his office, next to the fish tank. He predicted that Clinton’s campaign would be a “race to the bottom. ” Well, yes. There’s nothing like claims of moral high ground on a campaign. But I couldn’t help reminding Priebus that Trump recently accused President Bill Clinton of rape, Obama of treason, Hillary Clinton of murdering Vince Foster, Cruz’s dad of associating with assassins, Romney of not being a “real” Mormon and the rest of the litany. Where did the bottom even begin, and where could it possibly end? Priebus said that the rape and Vince Foster things were “sort of just warning shots to the Hillary campaign. ” He also claimed that Trump and Clinton were running “tied in the polls,” though this was being contradicted as we spoke. Clinton led Trump by 12 points in a new Bloomberg survey, with 55 percent of respondents saying they would never vote for the Republican and in an ABC   Post poll, seven in 10 Americans viewed Trump unfavorably, up 10 points in just the last month. A few days earlier, the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said that Republicans’ accepting Trump as the nominee was “like ignoring Stage IV cancer. ” There was a new wave of “Dump Trump” stories in the media, mostly featuring the same band of   Never Trumpers who seem to spend vast amounts of time on Twitter. I asked Priebus about any convention situation that could deny Trump the nomination. He did not reject the possibility, but it’s remote. It would require an alternative candidate (none currently) an organizing effort and a confluence of highly unlikely rule changes, delegate votes and procedural   whose likelihood Priebus compared to drawing an inside straight three times in a row. “I think people are living in Fantasy Land,” he said, not saying whether he shared in the fantasy. Priebus was heading out to catch a flight to Greensboro, N. C. for a   event with Trump that night. He was playing a role, the party guy, the proprietor of the china shop in the time of the bull. There was something oddly comforting to me about this presence, as thankless and unenviable as the life of Priebus might seem these days. What could be better for a lifer apparatchik? Priebus made a perfect   foil to a new politics of blazing chaos. “It could be a great moment or a bad moment,” Priebus told me. “But it’s going to be a moment. ” I thanked Priebus for his time. He was still fumbling with the cartoon Donald Trump coasters. “Your party’s made this story fun for me,” I told him. “Have I made it fun?” he asked, almost plaintively. “Or have I made it less fun?”",0

Most notably, in May of 2013, Senator McCain illegally entered into northern Syria to meet with known members of terrorist factions while claiming that they were  moderate rebels  not connected to extremist fighting groups.Following this trip, the false chemical weapons allegations implicating Syria s Assad soon appeared on the scene just months after McCain s planned visit.McCain later met with NeoNazi fascist leaders in Kiev, a few short months before Maidan Square melted down and the West s regime change took shape in the Ukraine.In the face of all this, McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee continues to be  hawkish  on Syria and calling for more than the 250 troops recently deployed to Syria.Will authorities account for all of the funds raised by Pitha and look at how they were appropriated?McCain s political career has been plagued by a series of blunders and scandals   one wonders if his campaign will be derailed by the charges against his former fundraiser or will this inconvenient truth get swept under the rug?Read more from Sputnik below   SCANDAL    US Senator John McCain (Photo link beforeitsnews.com)SputnikIs the beleaguered US Senator s reelection bid taking a page from the hit series Breaking Bad in a desperate attempt to appeal to young voters?

9115,"White, moldy and French: Russia's response to sanctions goes gourmet","VERKHNAYA PYSHMA/YEKATERINBURG, Russia (Reuters) - One thousand French goats have found a new home in Russia s Ural mountains as a local company bets on producing European-style cheeses no longer available for import. Russia banned the wholesale import of fresh food from the European Union, including dairy products, in response to sanctions imposed on Moscow after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.  But as images of steamrollers flattening illegally imported European cheeses were beamed across the country, Russian businesses were gearing up to fill the gap.  Investment in the production of sanctioned foodstuffs has grown, and in the Ural mountains the owners of mining company UMMC have added goats to their copper and coal assets. Iskandar Makhmudov and Andrey Kozytsin, both on the Forbes list of Russia s 100 richest people, are among UMMC s main shareholders.   Their company, UGMK-Agro, spent one million euros on trucking the Alpine goats 5,000 km from the Vendee region in France. Working out of a converted cowshed north of Yekaterinburg, it is aiming to be Russia s largest producer of white mold goat s cheese, a French delicacy. The company has invested 200 million rubles ($3.4 million)in cheese production and expects to turn a profit in six years.   For us, sanctions have of course played a positive role. We saw a gap in the market - not quite a deficit, but some room for maneuver,  Ilya Bondarev, CEO of UGMK-Agro, told Reuters.  With most Russians accustomed to semi-hard cheeses, part of the challenge will be encouraging buyers to try something new.   I m sorry but goat s cheese smells, and I don t like the taste of moldy cheeses,  said 30-year-old Alexander, a Yekaterinburg resident.  I prefer mozzarella and normal Russian cheeses, which remind me of my childhood,  he said. There is also the price. A kg of UGMK-Agro s B che-de-Ch vre cheese, sold under the  Coeur du Nord  brand, costs 2,200-2,500 rubles ($37-$43) versus 300-800 rubles per kg for standard Russian cheeses. UGMK-Agro plans to produce 500-700 kg of cheese a day by the spring of 2018.  We are launching in Moscow ... and are talking to distributors in St Petersburg,  Bondarev said.  But our main challenge is the creation of a local market.  ",0
45551,"FAKE NEWS: CNN Claims GOP Trying to Remove ’$200,000 Tax’ on Firearm Suppressors - Breitbart","During a January 14 report on Republican efforts to reduce restrictions on firearm suppressors, CNN said one of the GOP’s goals is to eliminate the “$200, 000 tax” on the devices. [CNN intimated that the GOP wants to get rid of the “lengthy background check” associated with suppressors as well.  In fact, the tax is $200 dollars —  not $200, 000 —  and the background check is one of the only current requirements that the GOP plans to keep in place for suppressors. What they want to get rid of is the bureaucracy of the purchase, whereby   citizens are required to be photographed, fingerprinted, and then to register their suppressor with the government. And yes, the GOP also wants to get rid of the $200 tax. CNN referenced the tax correctly later in the segment, but the mention of a “$200, 000 tax” was how they launched it. Representatives Jeff Duncan (  ) and John Carter (  ) introduced legislation on January 9 that will accomplish all these things. Their bill is the Hearing Protection Act and it is focused on the hearing benefits shooters and outdoorsmen receive from suppressed firearms. CNN’s Victor Blackwell addressed the Hearing Protection Act and said opponents of suppressors see any hearing benefits claims as a “facade. ” He then showed movie clips from Casino Royale and No Country for Old Men and a narrator said, “A gun silencer, shooting enthusiasts call it a suppressor. It’s an assassin’s must have in movies. ” The narrator says that opponents of the Hearing Protection Act say the real goal is “about militarizing weapons, not about hearing,” and that suppressor ownership “will allow mass shooters to kill stealthily. ” In reporting this way, CNN shows the Democrats’ hand —  as far as opposition to suppressors is concerned. They plan to fight against them the same way they fight against   stocks, flash hiders, and collapsible stocks via “assault weapons” bans. And they will try to shame   lawmakers into inaction by suggesting that suppressors make it possible to attack innocents without detection. Americans who are paying attention will quickly realize that the people making these arguments need to quit forming their opinions on suppressors from Hollywood films.
