16163,OBAMA CRITICIZES TRUMP For Comments About Illegals And Muslim Refugees…But What About THIS Video Of Obama’s Top 5 Most Violent Quotes About AMERICAN CITIZENS?,"President Obama, who as a candidate once urged supporters to  bring a gun  to the knife fight of his campaign, on Tuesday decried  vicious  rhetoric from Republican presidential candidates.Here is a great compilation of Obama s top 5 hits on his opponent (50% of America). Can you imagine the comments that haven t been recorded, like at the recent meeting with Black Lives Matter terrorists who were invited guests of Barack Obama s, coincidentally just prior to the organized Chicago Trump rally riots?During the annual  Friends of Ireland  luncheon at the U.S. Capitol, Mr. Obama told a bipartisan group of lawmakers that he is  more than a little dismayed about what s happening on the campaign trail lately. Never one to miss out on the opportunity to bash his enemies our very un-statesman like Community Organizer In Chief took the opportunity when speaking in front of the Prime Minister of Ireland to not talk about relations with Ireland, but instead, to bash Donald Trump. He made it clear to this group who has absolutely nothing to do with our elections, that he is watching his every move Trump makes and will use every opportunity, no matter how inappropriate, to damage his reputation. Probably the most sickening and dishonest part of this video is when Obama begrudgingly tells Speaker Of The House, Paul Ryan (R) that, I know you are a great father and a great husband  and that, We can have political debates without turning on each other  at the 7:45 mark: We have heard vulgar and divisive rhetoric aimed at women and minorities   at Americans who don t look like  us,  or pray like  us  or vote like we do,  Mr. Obama said in an obvious reference to Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump.  We ve seen misguided attempts to shut down that speech, however offensive it may be. In response to those attempts, we ve seen actual violence, and we ve heard silence from too many of our leaders. As he has increasingly in recent days, Mr. Obama lamented  any effort to spread fear or encourage violence, or to shut people down when they re trying to speak, or turn Americans against one another. As a citizen who will still be leading this office, I will not support somebody who practices that kind of politics,  the president said.But as a candidate for the White House in 2008, Mr. Obama was no stranger to violent rhetoric. He encouraged the notion that he was a product of Chicago s particularly tough brand of politics.At a campaign event in Philadelphia in June 2008, Mr. Obama told supporters,  If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun. Because from what I understand, folks in Philly like a good brawl. I ve seen Eagles fans. Later that year, as polls showed a close race between Mr. Obama and Republican nominee John McCain, Mr. Obama urged a crowd of about 1,500 at a campaign rally in Elko, Nevada, to get confrontational in their community for him. I need you to go out and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors,  Mr. Obama said.  I want you to talk to them whether they are independent or whether they are Republican. I want you to argue with them and get in their face. The president on Tuesday seemed to be referring to such comments of his own when he remarked,  All of us can recall some intemperate words that we regret. Certainly, I can. And while some may be more to blame than others for the current climate, all of us are responsible for reversing it. Via: Washington Times",1
50298,Yemen car bomb attack kills at least two people in Aden: residents,"ADEN (Reuters) - Assailants detonated a car bomb outside the Yemeni Finance Ministry offices in the southern city of Aden on Wednesday, killing at least two people, hospital officials and residents said. They said the force of the blast shook the Khor Maksar area of Aden, the temporary capital of the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, and causing severe damage to the six-storey building. The force of the blast also shattered windows of adjacent houses, they said.   Ambulances were seen racing to the scene, as sounds of gunfire were heard in the area, they said. No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion. An official at the city s main government-run Jumhouriya hospital said that two people have arrived dead to the hospital, while three others were in critical condition. He said that medics have said they believe that more casualties were at the scene of the blast, but no one could reach them due to an exchange of gunfire that was taking place in the area. ",0
67671, Russia Hack Bigger Than We Thought; Electrical Grid Threatened,"As President Obama is threatening and acting out on retaliation for Russia s hack of the United States election, it s becoming evident that the hack was even bigger. According to a report in the Washington Post, the Vermont electric utility was also hacked.While the Russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a security matter, the discovery underlines the vulnerabilities of the nation s electrical grid. Officials in government and the utility industry regularly monitor the grid because it is highly computerized and any disruptions can have disastrous implications for the country s medical and emergency services.No one is sure at this point why the Russians hacked the small utility, but it s possible that they did it just to show us they can. It could also have been a test, similar to the way credit card thieves start with small charges to test the card.This is also far from out of character for Russia. Earlier in 2016, Russia allegedly hacked the power grid in the Ukraine.The hackers who struck the power centers in Ukraine the first confirmed hack to take down a power grid weren t opportunists who just happened upon the networks and launched an attack to test their abilities; according to new details from an extensive investigation into the hack, they were skilled and stealthy strategists who carefully planned their assault over many months, first doing reconnaissance to study the networks and siphon operator credentials, then launching a synchronized assault in a well-choreographed dance. It was brilliant,  says Robert M. Lee, who assisted in the investigation. Lee is a former cyber warfare operations officer for the US Air Force and is co-founder of Dragos Security, a critical infrastructure security company.  In terms of sophistication, most people always [focus on the] malware [that s used in an attack],  he says.  To me what makes sophistication is logistics and planning and operations and   what s going on during the length of it. And this was highly sophisticated. Source: WiredWhile Lee couldn t say for sure it was Russia, the Ukraine is convinced it was. Nonetheless, Lee said, it was a very well-funded operation and it could have been from a nation-state.As Wired notes, the electrical infrastructure in the Ukraine is more secure than it is overall in the United States. Beyond that, many of our electrical grids don t have backup, which means that it could be hours, days, or even longer before we get power back.Even more frightening, the entire nation could be without power indefinitely if just nine of its 55,000 substations were hit by terrorists or by hackers.A coordinated attack on just nine of the United States  55,000 electric-transmission substations on the right day could cause a blackout from Los Angeles to New York City, according to the study conducted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The study s results have been known for months to select people in federal agencies, Congress and the White House, but were reported publicly for the first time Wednesday. The WSJ did not publish a list of the 30 most critical substations identified by the FERC study.One particularly troubling memo reviewed by the Journal described a scenario in which a highly-coordinated but relatively small scale attack could send the country into a long-term literal dark age.  Destroy nine interconnection substations and a transformer manufacturer and the entire United States grid would be down for at least 18 months, probably longer,  the memo said.Source: TimeOne of Donald Trump s campaign promises has been to improve the infrastructure. Obama has been trying to do that for most of his time in office, but Congress has blocked that. Still, even if Trump does get an infrastructure bill signed, his relationship with Russia is troubling. Will his loyalty be with the United States or is he indebted enough to Russia that he will leave the doors open for them to attack us where we are the most vulnerable? It s a disconcerting question, to say the least, and it s why the hacking of the election, along with Trump s praise of Putin, is a big f*cking deal.UPDATE: The Washington Post has issued a correction. The utility was hacked, but that Vermont utility is not corrected to the grid. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Russian hackers had penetrated the U.S. electric grid. Authorities say there is no indication of that so far. The computer at Burlington Electric that was hacked was not attached to the grid,  an editor s note attached to the original article said.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",1
48681,Life: Animal Rights Win: The San Diego Zoo Has Taped Telescopes To All Of Their Animals’ Heads So That They Can Look At The Planets,"Email 
No matter how you feel about zoos, this story will make you feel good. 
Zoo administrators are always experimenting with ways to make their animals’ caged experiences as accommodating to their needs as possible, with varying degrees of success. But thanks to an innovative and humane new initiative, one of our most beloved institutions is setting a new standard for animal rights. The San Diego Zoo has taped telescopes to all of their animals’ heads so that they can look at the planets. 
What a tremendous step forward! 
For decades, the San Diego Zoo led the way in terms of tourist attractions, but this latest move proves that they are even more committed to treating their animals with dignity. With a telescope affixed to each animal’s head, these incredible creatures can now gaze at the planets just by looking up. Visitors can take great comfort knowing that the ostriches, chinchillas, and all other animals are no longer limited to just looking at trees, dirt, or clouds, as they had been for so many heartbreaking years. 
According to president and CEO Douglas Myers, the project directly addresses a basic right of all animals. 
“When you consider the challenges we face when improving animal captivity, strapping a telescope snugly to each animal’s head is a no-brainer,” said Myers. “These are beautiful creatures that deserve to look at the planets.” 
Indeed, most zoo animals have never had the ability to take in the wonders of our galaxy, but in San Diego it’s now a key part of every animal’s care plan. At any moment, an otter can swivel his head and take a look at Saturn. A zebra can glance up from grazing to observe a sea of constellations seemingly close enough to lick. And when the park welcomed a new fox last month, tourists were able to watch as zoologists strapped a tiny telescope to his head, equipped with a polarized filter to protect his sensitive eyes. 
Wow! 
Well, if you needed another reason to finally visit the San Diego Zoo, you’ve officially got it. Hopefully, this will encourage zoos everywhere to continue to explore new ways to address the welfare of their animals. Thankfully, they now have an excellent place to start.",1
49117,MICHIGAN MAN Charged with Threatening to Assassinate President Trump,"Can you imagine being POTUS and having this threat every day while you re in the WhiteHouse? The threats are there but this type of threat is frightening because this man is apparently mentally ill. We were unable to find any pictures of this man. He made vile and graphic threats to President Trump and was charged:A truck driver has been charged in federal court with threatening to assassinate President Donald Trump in several phone calls to Secret Service field offices.Special Agent Matthew Lariviere wrote in a criminal complaint unsealed Tuesday that James Anthony Jackson repeatedly called the Secret Service field office in Chicago on Oct. 12-13 and made more phone calls to the field office in Detroit on Oct. 18 threatening to  blow Trump s brains out. Better watch Donald Trump ass, ya bitch,  Jackson said, according to court records.  Ya ll think someone playing with yo dumbasses, I am going to blow white brains out   his (expletive) head. It appeared Jackson was masking his real number, according to the agent.Jackson called from a phone with a 616 area code number.The number was registered to James Jackson Profit Group LLC in Grand Rapids, according to the agent. The company, which does not appear in state business records, is linked to an outreach center in Grand Rapids.Phone records also showed Jackson frequently called a woman in the 517 area code. The woman told investigators she had met a man online named  Jamie  who had harassed and threatened her from the same Grand Rapids-area phone number used by Jackson.Jamie threatened to  cut off her head and parade it in front of the White House for Trump,  according to the court filing.On Friday, investigators interviewed Jackson s uncle.Jackson had cursed and threatened relatives, the uncle said.Agents played a recording of one of the Trump threats for Jackson s sister and she confirmed the voice belonged to Jackson, according to the complaint.The News reports Jackson was born in 1984 but a hometown wasn t available and the U.S. Attorney s Office refused to discuss the case.Via Detroit NewsVia: WNEM",1
63255,Mattis says Iran 'fundamentally' in compliance with nuclear deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday Iran was fundamentally in compliance with its nuclear deal, as President Donald Trump s administration weighs whether the 2015 deal serves U.S. security interests. Trump faces an Oct. 15 deadline for certifying that Iran is complying with the pact, a decision that could sink an agreement strongly supported by the other powers that negotiated it, including Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union.  I believe that they fundamentally are. There have been certainly some areas where they were not temporarily in that regard, but overall our intelligence community believes that they have been compliant and the IAEA also says so,  Mattis said during a House of Representatives hearing, using an acronym for the International Atomic Energy Agency.

24106,"With Blacks Alarmed by His Tone, Trump Meets With Martin Luther King III - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   With tensions escalating between   Donald J. Trump and prominent black leaders, Mr. Trump met privately on Monday with the eldest son of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the holiday devoted to the civil rights hero. The hastily arranged meeting at Trump Tower occurred as Mr. Trump feuded publicly with  Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, who fought for civil rights alongside Dr. King. It has highlighted the challenges Mr. Trump faces as he prepares to take office on Friday deeply distrusted by minorities across the country, many of whom have been offended by his false allegations that President Obama was born outside the United States, appalled that his candidacy drew backing from white supremacist organizations, and dismayed at policy proposals they consider antithetical to their interests. Mr. Trump on Monday did not address those issues, appearing in the lobby to allow news cameras to capture pictures of him shaking hands with Martin Luther King III, but ignoring questions shouted by reporters about their conversation or his statements about Mr. Lewis. Tentative plans for Mr. Trump to visit the Smithsonian Museum of   History and Culture in Washington, as the nation paused to remember Dr. King, had been shelved in favor of the   session, which lasted just under one hour. But Mr. Trump made sure that journalists had an opportunity to see him with Mr. King, a visual manifestation of his stated aspiration to unite a divided nation. Mr. King said the session, which included a discussion about voting rights, had been “constructive,” and described Mr. Trump as eager to present himself as inclusive. “He said that he is going to represent Americans  —   he’s said that over and over again,” Mr. King, the president of the Drum Major Institute, a progressive New   public policy organization, told reporters. “We will continue to evaluate that. ” On Monday, Mr. King sought to defuse the furor surrounding Mr. Trump’s remarks about Mr. Lewis, saying, “In the heat of emotion, a lot of things get said on both sides. ” Mr. King has pressed for the creation of a free photographic government identification card to make it easier for Americans who do not have driver’s licenses, including many black voters, to cast ballots, and he indicated on Monday that Mr. Trump had taken an interest in the plan. “It is very clear that the system is not working at its maximum,” Mr. King told reporters. “We believe we provided a solution. ” But other leaders said Mr. Trump’s relationship with    —   tense bordering on toxic after a strident campaign that instilled fear, and a transition that has done little to allay their concerns  —   would not improve unless the   altered both his tone and his policy positions. “There’s a lot of anxiety, there’s a lot of distrust, there are people who have expressed to me that they’re scared of what his policies might entail,” said Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League. Mr. Trump won election with 8 percent of the   vote, according to exit polls. A Pew Research Center poll in November found roughly   of African Americans believed race relations would worsen during his presidency. The Rev. Al Sharpton said nothing underscored Mr. Trump’s challenge more vividly than his outburst in a pair of Twitter postings on Saturday that called Mr. Lewis, who was brutally beaten in the “Bloody Sunday” march in 1965 in Selma, Ala. “all talk,” and said that instead of “falsely complaining” about the election results, he should focus on fixing his “falling apart” and “crime infested” Georgia district. Mr. Lewis actually represents a district that includes part of the wealthy enclave of Buckhead the world’s busiest airport,   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Mr. Trump’s remarks were a reaction to an interview on Friday in which Mr. Lewis said he would not attend the inauguration and did not see Mr. Trump as a legitimate president because of questions about whether Russian hacking had affected the American election. “If you can disrespect John Lewis on Martin Luther King Day, then what are you saying about the rest of us?” Mr. Sharpton said, adding that no single meeting Mr. Trump could hold would alleviate the concerns felt in the   community. “He seems to have a   very negative view of what black America looks like, and that is frightening to many black Americans. ” Mr. Sharpton said he was concerned that Mr. Trump was more interested in public appearances than substantive meetings with   activists and lawmakers to address issues of voting rights, criminal justice and policing reform, health care and economic inequality. “He still thinks that we’re playing television red carpet here, rather than dealing with the presidency of the United States, with something of real substance. This is not a ” Rev. Sharpton said. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump’s press secretary and communications director, announced the meeting in New York between Mr. Trump and Mr. King in a morning posting on Twitter. In a series of television interviews on Monday, Mr. Spicer said Mr. Lewis had started the fight with his “disappointing” assertion that Mr. Trump was not a legitimate president, and he defended the  ’s decision to respond, telling CBS that the   is “not going to sit back and just take attacks without responding. ” Still, Mr. Trump himself had seemed to temper his attack on Mr. Lewis subtly by Saturday night he said that the congressman should help him focus on “burning and crime infested  ” throughout the United States and added, “I can use all the help I can get!” Outside the   history museum in Washington on Monday, some visitors argued that the episode said more about the  ’s thin skin than his views on race. “Somebody said something bad and he’s got to say something back,” said Nancy Alston of Columbia, Md. “He said bad stuff about Meryl Streep, too. ” Ginelle Johnson, 35, of San Diego, said that she believed Mr. Trump’s comments were motivated by how he views minorities. But she also said that they appeared to show his proclivity to hit back at whoever criticizes him. “Politics has become entertainment and I think Trump is just a bully,” Ms. Johnson said. Mr. Trump’s brief sighting on Monday afternoon at Trump Tower was a striking contrast to President Obama, who spent part of Monday  —   his final observance of Martin Luther King’s Birthday in office  —   making a stop at a homeless shelter in Washington. Earlier, his wife, Michelle Obama, had spoken out subtly in her own Twitter post, saying she was, “Thinking of Dr. King and great leaders like @repjohnlewis who carry on his legacy. ” “May their example be our call to action,” she wrote.",0
43618,Appellate judge Kelly considered for Supreme Court: NYT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is vetting federal appellate Judge Jane Kelly for a possible U.S. Supreme Court nomination to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing a person with knowledge of the process. The FBI has been conducting background interviews on Kelly, the Times said, citing the unnamed source. Scalia, a long-serving conservative justice, died on Feb. 13. The White House declined to comment on the report. Kelly, a white woman and former public defender, has served on the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since April 2013. She was confirmed to the post by the Senate on a 96-0 vote.  She had been mentioned by legal experts as a potential nominee in part because her earlier nomination to the appeals court was supported by Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that would review any Supreme Court nomination. Grassley said at the time that Kelly was “well regarded in my home state of Iowa” and that he was “pleased to support” her nomination.  Kelly, 51, served as a clerk for now-retired Judge David Hansen, a friend of Grassley who served on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Republican leaders have so far rebuffed President Barack Obama’s appeal to hold confirmation hearings and a vote on a nominee, including in a face-to-face meeting on Tuesday at the White House that failed to budge them from their vow to block anyone he offers for the job. Republicans say the decision on who to nominate should be left to the next president, who takes office next January after the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Republicans hope to win back the White House then. Under the U.S. Constitution, the president nominates Supreme Court justices and the Senate must confirm them. Without Scalia, the court has four conservative and four liberal justices, meaning any potential Obama nominee could tip the court to the left for the first time in decades. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, a moderate Republican, took himself out of consideration for appointment to the Supreme Court last week, a day after his name surfaced in connection with the Scalia vacancy.

65410,Tech billionaire Thiel says Trump movement 'not going away',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Billionaire technology investor Peter Thiel, a lightning rod for criticism in Silicon Valley for his support of Donald Trump, predicted on Monday that the movement the Republican presidential nominee has created would carry on even if he loses his bid for the White House on Nov. 8. “No matter what happens in this election, what Trump represents isn’t crazy, and it’s not going away,” Thiel said in a speech to reporters at the National Press Club in Washington.  Thiel, who announced earlier this month he was donating $1.25 million to help Trump get elected, said the New York businessman was laying the groundwork for “a new Republican Party” that will go “beyond the dogmas of Reaganism.” Thiel attacked Washington in his remarks, saying its elite insiders were out of touch with ordinary Americans and that Trump was shaking up a system in need of change.         “The truth is, no matter how crazy this election seems, it is less crazy than the condition of our country,” said Thiel. While it is impossible to predict what will happen to Trump and his followers after the election, Thiel is not alone in his view. “This will certainly continue after Nov. 8, whether Donald Trump is leading the movement or not,” Republican strategist Alice Stewart said on Monday, arguing that the movement surrounding Trump will have lasting effects on the Republican Party. “Without a doubt, Trump has tapped into an electorate that has felt like their voices have not been heard in quite some time,” she said, adding that the Republican Party old guard would have to work with followers of Trump’s newer brand of conservatism, regardless of the outcome of the election, if the party is to survive. Thiel, who was born in Germany and came to the United States as a child, is best known as a co-founder of online payment service PayPal Holdings Inc and an early backer of online social network Facebook Inc. His support for the real estate developer and reality TV star has made him a target for scorn in liberal-leaning tech circles, especially after his full-throated endorsement of Trump at the Republican National Convention in July. The only major-name Trump backer in Silicon Valley, Thiel has attracted criticism and some have called for Thiel’s removal from Facebook’s board. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has insisted on Thiel staying, citing the importance of diversity of opinion at the company.  Trump’s tirades against cross-border trade agreements and immigration run counter to the views of most in the U.S. tech industry, which sells its products worldwide and has leaned heavily on talented programmers coming to the United States from overseas.  On Monday, Thiel accused the media of taking too literally many of Trump’s more controversial proposals, including imposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. He also said the comments Trump made about groping and kissing women in a 2005 video that was made public earlier this month were “clearly offensive and inappropriate.”  But Thiel said he and other Trump supporters were voting on policy, not personality. He added that both Trump and White House rival Democrat Hillary Clinton were “imperfect people, to say the least.”  On top of his political views, Thiel has faced a backlash in the media for secretly funding a lawsuit against the online publishing company Gawker Media by former professional wrestler Terry Bollea, known professionally as Hulk Hogan, that ultimately led to the bankruptcy and sale of Gawker.  Thiel on Monday defended his decision to bankroll the suit against the site, which a decade earlier outed Thiel as gay in an article entitled “Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.” Thiel said the judicial system was too costly for all but the very rich. “If you’re a single-digit millionaire like Hulk Hogan, you have no effective access to the legal system,” he said. Clinton holds a 5-point lead over Trump in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, with the backing of 44 percent of likely voters compared to Trump with 39 percent.  ",0
15198,Doctors in Aleppo Tend to Scores of Victims in Gas Attack - The New York Times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   As rebel negotiators unveiled a new plan on Wednesday for a political transition in Syria, doctors in the city of Aleppo were still treating people in intensive care after an attack believed to involve the use of chlorine gas sickened more than 120 people, including 10 women and 37 children. At least two people died in the attack, which witnesses said was carried out by government forces in the   section of Aleppo. Rescuers and citizen journalists who went to the scene said by text message that there had been a strong smell of bleach. One of the victims, a    girl named Hajer Kyali, died Wednesday afternoon. She had been in intensive care since the attack, which doctors said they believed had struck her family’s house directly, delivering a deadly dose of the gas. Medical staff members described seeing people with symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, sneezing, irritation of the eyes, nausea and in some cases respiratory failure. Such symptoms are consistent with attacks involving chlorine, which can kill in high concentrations. Rescue workers also said that four members of the White Helmets volunteer rescue group had been killed responding to attacks in the past day in the provinces of Aleppo and Idlib, both in “ ” strikes that hit the area a second time to target rescuers. The rescue workers said the Sukari district, the same neighborhood hit by the suspected chlorine attack on Tuesday, was struck on Wednesday by two barrel bombs, killing an estimated 20 people, according to witnesses and rescuers. Doctors were still working to confirm the final death toll. In London, the Syrian oppositions’ negotiating body, the High Negotiations Committee, presented a new vision of a political transition to end the civil war, now in its sixth year. The group said that it would preserve the human rights of all Syrians and the institutions of the state, including the military, and seek to avoid the mistakes made by the United States occupation in Iraq. That means having a military council made up of both   and opposition figures, and no wholesale purges, with punishment only for those directly responsible for crimes. The committee’s leader, Riyad Hijab, a former Syrian prime minister who defected after a crackdown on protests that began in 2011, laid out the plan in London at a meeting of countries supporting the opposition. He said that the group could talk with members of President Bashar  ’s government but that, at the end of the negotiation process, Mr. Assad should leave office  —   a proposal that fails to resolve an impasse with Russia and the Assad government, which insist that he can stay in office during a political transition. The gas attack came three years after the Syrian government agreed to give up its chemical weapons program under a deal brokered by the United States and Russia. It also accompanied several days of intense aerial bombardment of eastern Aleppo by government and allied Russian forces that have continued as Russian and American diplomats seek to negotiate a   deal. There was no independent confirmation of who carried out the attack or that chlorine was used the Assad government and its armed opponents have accused each other of using chlorine as a weapon of war. A recent United Nations report determined that both the government and Islamic State militants have used chemical weapons on several occasions. In Aleppo, the forces fighting the government range from groups with American backing to factions that until recently were officially affiliated with Al Qaeda. The Islamic State is not a player in the city. The first death reported from the gas attack in Sukari was that of Abdulkareem Afefa, 29. Numerous videos and photographs that doctors, rescuers and witnesses shared online showed men, women and children being treated with oxygen. Abdelkafi   an activist and citizen journalist who filmed the aftermath of the attack, said that when he arrived at the scene, the fumes were still so strong that he could not catch his breath. “I couldn’t speak to the camera without a mask,” he said. Mr. Hamdo said that some people at the scene had reached such a level of despair  —   having concluded that publicizing such attacks brings no help from the outside world and may even bring more danger  —   that they tried to stop him from filming. “Some people think that if they told the world that they are being killed, Assad will drop many weapons on them,” he said. He added that people had told him they believed the government was targeting civilians to encourage them to flee, and that showing many civilian victims makes the area a good target for the next attack. “The message from Assad and Russia is this: ‘You have to accept my conditions or die,’” he said. The sputtering negotiations over a   include a Russian proposal for civilians to leave the area residents fear they will never be allowed back. Russia and the government say that civilians have been taken hostage by the fighters in   areas. “Nothing, just chemical once again, don’t worry, don’t be sad, it is normal,” Aref   an   activist with the Aleppo Media Center, said in a sarcastic text message as he shared his photographs of victims. In 2013, after sarin gas attacks killed more than 1, 000 people in   suburbs of Damascus, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution authorizing militarily enforceable sanctions for any party using chemical weapons in Syria. But Russia has blocked the use of those sanctions against the Syrian government, which denies it was responsible. Under threat of United States retaliation for the sarin attacks, the government agreed to eliminate its previously secret chemical weapons program. Chlorine gas is not listed as a banned chemical weapon in the international Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria agreed to join under the agreement, but its use as a military weapon is banned under international law.",0
22303,Goldman's Donovan to withdraw from deputy Treasury secretary nomination: source,"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker James Donovan who was nominated by U.S. President Donald Trump as deputy Treasury secretary, has withdrawn his name, according to a person familiar with the matter. Donovan will return to Goldman, the person added, asking not to be named because the matter is private. He withdrew from the position for personal reasons, the person said. Donovan could not be reached immediately for comment but a Treasury Department official confirmed he was withdrawing. “Secretary (Steven) Mnuchin offers Jim his support and friendship as he focuses his attention on his family,” Treasury Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tony Sayegh said in a statement. “Jim has been an enormous asset to the department helping recruit and fill many of the senior jobs at Treasury.

8540,"Kim Jong Un praises nuclear program, promotes sister","SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea s leader Kim Jong Un said his nuclear weapons were a  powerful deterrent  that guaranteed its sovereignty, state media reported on Sunday, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said  only one thing will work  in dealing with the isolated country. Trump did not make clear to what he was referring, but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind.  In a speech to a meeting of the powerful Central Committee of the ruling Workers  Party on Saturday, a day before Trump s most recent comments, state media said Kim had addressed the  complicated international situation . North Korea s nuclear weapons are a  powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia,  Kim said, referring to the  protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists.  In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. North Korea is preparing to test-launch such a missile, a Russian lawmaker who had just returned from a visit to Pyongyang was quoted as saying on Friday. Donald Trump has previously said the United States would  totally destroy  North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies. The situation proved that North Korea s policy of  byungjin , meaning the parallel development of nuclear weapons and the economy was  absolutely right , Kim Jong Un said in the speech.  The national economy has grown on their strength this year, despite the escalating sanctions,  said Kim, referring to U.N. Security Council resolutions put in place to curb Pyongyang s nuclear and missile program.  The meeting also handled some personnel changes inside North Korea s secretive and opaque ruling center of power, state media said. Kim Jong Un s sister, Kim Yo Jong, was made an alternate member of the politburo - the top decision-making body over which Kim Jong Un presides. Alongside Kim Jong Un himself, the promotion makes Kim Yo Jong the only other millennial member of the influential body. Her new position indicates the 28-year-old has become a replacement for Kim Jong Un s aunt, Kim Kyong Hui, who had been a key decision maker when former leader Kim Jong Il was alive.  It shows that her portfolio and writ is far more substantive than previously believed and it is a further consolidation of the Kim family s power,  said Michael Madden, a North Korea expert at Johns Hopkins University s 38 North website. In January, the U.S. Treasury blacklisted Kim Yo Jong along with other North Korean officials over  severe human rights abuses . Kim Jong Sik and Ri Pyong Chol, two of the three men behind Kim s banned rocket program, were also promoted. State media announced that several other high ranking cadres were promoted to the Central Committee in what the South Korean unification ministry said could be an attempt by North Korea to navigate a way through its increasing isolation.  The large-scale personnel reshuffle reflects that Kim Jong Un is taking the current situation seriously, and that he s looking for a breakthrough by promoting a new generation of politicians,  the ministry said in a statement. North Korea s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho, who named Donald Trump  President Evil  in a bombastic speech to the U.N. General Assembly last month, was promoted to full vote-carrying member of the politburo.  Ri can now be safely identified as one of North Korea s top policy makers,  said Madden.  Even if he has informal or off the record meetings, Ri s interlocutors can be assured that whatever proposals they proffer will be taken directly to the top,  he said.  ",0
64932,Louisiana governor says state's finances in dire situation,"(Reuters) - Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards presented a dire picture of the state’s fiscal situation on Thursday, urging lawmakers to consider a set of budget cuts and revenue-raising measures, including tax increases. Edwards made his remarks before state legislators convene for a special session on Sunday to hash out how to fix the budget woes. The state is contending with a $940 million budget deficit for the current fiscal year and a $2 billion projected deficit for the next fiscal year starting in July. “This is a historic fiscal crisis, the likes of which our state has never seen,” Edwards said during Thursday’s televised address. He warned that the state’s public colleges and universities will face “catastrophic cuts over the next four months.” Louisiana is at risk of not being able to pay student scholarships that have already been awarded, and some campuses will be forced to cancel classes, even file for bankruptcy. “If you are a student attending one of these universities, it means that you will receive a grade of incomplete, many students will not be able to graduate,” said Edwards. “You can say farewell to college football next fall.” The governor also warned that the state’s healthcare system was “on the verge of imploding.” Without new revenues, hospitals that care for a significant portion of poor and under-insured patients would close in places like Lake Charles, Alexandria and Bogalusa. “I don’t say this to scare you. But I am going to be honest with you. No more tricks. No more smoke and mirrors,” said Edwards, a Democrat who took office last month. Louisiana’s former Governor Bobby Jindal had signed a “no tax” pledge, which handicapped the state from raising new revenues. Edwards on Thursday juxtaposed Louisiana’s finances when Jindal took office in 2008 - when the state enjoyed a $1 billion surplus - to today, when the state is facing a looming $2 billion projected deficit. The budget problems in Louisiana, a big oil-producing state, stem in part from the global drop in oil prices, in addition to the state’s reliance in recent years on one-time money and lower-than-expected revenues.  Edwards has proposed several budget fixes, including a 1-cent sales tax hike and increases to alcohol and cigarette taxes. He would freeze hiring for state workers, reduce state contracts, and cut $160 million of state funding. He has also proposed tapping $128 million from the rainy day fund and $200 million from non-coastal BP payments to reduce the current year deficit. ",0
23377,Syrian hostages who escaped Islamic State receive rapturous homecoming,"Qaryatayn, SYRIA (Reuters) - Twenty six Syrian hostages who escaped from their Islamic State captors received an emotional homecoming on Sunday in the central province of Homs, witnesses and officials said.   They were among at least 70 people abducted and taken by fleeing Islamic State militants to a secret location in the desert east of the town of al-Qaryatayn on Oct. 21 when the Syrian army and pro-government militias regained control of the town.  The others are still missing, according to local officials, who have not disclosed the identities of any of the hostages.   Al-Qaryatayn lies nearly 300 kilometers (190 miles) west of Deir al-Zor city, the current focus of the Syrian government s offensive, with Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, against Islamic State. About 200 people turned out in al-Qaryatayn on Sunday to welcome home the returning hostages, according to Reuters reporters who visited the war-scarred town during a trip organized by the Syrian authorities. Parents wept as they embraced returning sons while other relatives and local residents threw sweets and sugar in the air in celebration.   Thank God for your return,  said an elderly man as he embraced a young man. Most in the crowd declined to be interviewed.  Syrian authorities said jihadists had taken revenge after being forced out after three weeks of fighting around the outskirts of al-Qaryatayn, by slaughtering scores of the city s inhabitants. A senior local official said the hostages escaped after they got past an Iraqi jihadist militant while he took a nap and seized his gun and shot him dead. But the joy surrounding the hostages  return was still overshadowed by executions witnessed in the town in the past few weeks when militants rounded up local officials and members of the security forces, police and members of their families and executed them in broad daylight, according to officials.    We forgot our joy when thinking of the nightmare that we went through,  Found Ghosn, a local government official told Reuters TV, saying city officials had identified at least 70 out of 130 people slain during the revenge killings.

48895,"FBI Finds New Evidence, Reopens Investigation Into Clinton E-mail","Email 
Hillary Clinton may not be completely in the clear on her use of a private, unsecured e-mail server used to send and receive classified information during her time as secretary of state. FBI Director James Comey announced on Friday — in a letter to high-ranking members of Congress — that the FBI is reopening the investigation on the basis of new information. 
The letter was addressed to Senator Richard Burr (R-N.C.), chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence; Senator Charles “Chuck” Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman, Committee on the Judiciary; Senator Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), chairman, Committee on Appropriations and Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and related Agencies; Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; Representative Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; Representative Robert “Bob” Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairman, Committee on the Judiciary; Representative John Culberson (R-Texas), chairman, Committee on Appropriations and Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and related Agencies; and Representative Jayson Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. 
Comey — who declined to recommend an indictment against Clinton after the conclusion of the previous investigation in July — wrote to the chairmen of these committees to say that “in connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation” of Clinton. Due to this new information, Comey wrote that he believes “it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony” regarding the investigation into whether Clinton knowingly broke the law. 
Comey did not say what the “unrelated case” is or how it is connected to Clinton’s e-mails. He did say that he had been briefed about the newly discovered e-mails on Thursday and wrote, “I agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” CNN’s Evan Perez reported that law enforcement sources say the new e-mails are not from to WikiLeaks and are not about the Clinton Foundation. 
In response to the letter, Representative Bob Goodlatte released a statement which said: The FBI’s decision to reopen its investigation into Secretary Clinton reinforces what the House Judiciary Committee has been saying for months: the more we learn about Secretary Clinton’s use of a private email server, the clearer it becomes that she and her associates committed wrongdoing and jeopardized national security. Now that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness. The American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law. 
Jason Chaffetz tweeted about the letter, saying, “FBI Dir just informed me, ""The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation."" Case reopened.” 
The Clinton campaign claimed not to have had any previous knowledge of this most recent development. A Clinton aide reportedly told CNN, “We’re learning about this just like you all are.” That sounds strangely similar to President Obama’s claim that he learned about Clinton’s private e-mail server from news reports — a claim the White House later had to walk back. 
Caught off guard, Clinton’s running mate, Tim Kaine, was asked about the reopened investigation while campaigning in Tallahassee, Florida. The only response he offered to reporters was, “Got to read a little more, got to read a little more.” 
Donald Trump — who told Clinton in the second presidential debate that if he is elected, he will have her investigated and that the conclusion is “you’d be in jail.” — seized the opportunity to make a statement before giving a prepared speech in Manchester, New Hampshire. He told the audience, “They are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States,” adding, “We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.” 
Comey was careful in his letter to say that “the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant,” adding that “I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work.” This new phase of the investigation may — in keeping with a Clinton family tradition — continue past the election, and — if Clinton is elected — result in impeachment proceedings against her.

29228, Trump BANS Campaign Volunteers From Talking About Him FOREVER,"Campaign volunteers are key to a winning presidential campaign. Unpaid supporters are the most solid of true believers in a politician, and most campaigns would do anything to attract them and get them doing the grunt work that wins elections.Not Donald Trump.His so-called  ground game  of volunteers in swing states has been slow to catch-up with Hillary Clinton s massive operation that have been working to register voters and get them to the polls since before the primaries began last winter.But another reason Trump is behind the curve may be his own ego. It has come to light that as part of volunteering for Trump s 2016 presidential campaign, volunteers must sign an unusual non-disclosure agreement document that bars them from ever speaking about him:The Enquirer reports that the agreement  is a required part of the sign-up process for Trump Red Dialer, an online call system that connects volunteers for the Republican presidential candidate with potential voters,  and that a spokesman dodged a question about why they re necessary. We are running a state-of-the-art campaign for Mr. Trump that involves best-in-market volunteer platforms, and it is attracting thousands of volunteers who are tired of the same old Washington corruption and back room deals and are securing votes for a change in November,  Trump Ohio spokesman Seth Unger said.The contract specifies that volunteers could face financial damages if they violate the agreement by speaking about Trump. Similar agreements have been discussed before in the campaign, as one was apparently signed by former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. The extremely expansive terms of the agreement led to him losing a book deal, and he actually could face a major lawsuit   as another former campaign staffer did, later settled   if he even criticized the campaign as part of his work as a commentator at CNN.ThinkProgress reports that by comparison, the Clinton campaign doesn t require anyone to sign anything before working for the campaign as a phone banker. Sounds like they want to win, instead of stroking the candidate s ego.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons",1
3542, Dear Trump: ISIS Is NOT A Football Game,"When Donald Trump talks about America, he often talks about how we don t  win anymore.  We don t win on manufacturing. We don t win on trade. We don t win on economics. We don t win against ISIS. It s that last point I wish to address, because Trump said at a recent rally: Our military can t beat ISIS. Can you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur or the great General George Patton saying we can t beat ISIS. Patton would rip your heart out if you ever said that. We can t beat   right? Can you imagine that though? Can you imagine what   they re spinning right now. They re watching. They re spinning in their grave. You, Donnie Trump, go on, and speak like MacArthur and Patton talk to you. You sound like you ve assured them you can win here, and you ll do them proud. Is that how you see it, Donnie?You re ignoring an awful lot there, Donnie. Neither MacArthur nor Patton behaved the way you do. They were tacticians, not juggernauts who rolled to victory in every single engagement. They knew when to steamroll, and when to pull back and regroup. In your crusade against anything that even remotely looks like weakness, you ve taught your dense and idiotic followers that winning against ISIS is as simple as a football game.Simply act like we can win, and we ll win.I m sure that our dear Mr. Trump does not see anything wrong with talking this way. After all, nothing he ever does is wrong. Period. End of. However, the problem is not how he sees it. The problem is the message he s putting forth. He s treating war, and terrorism, like they re football games. If we just think positively, believe we can win, and stop acting like we can t beat ISIS, we ll beat them handily.That s not true.Generals Patton and MacArthur were so successful in part because they were realistic. There were massive failures during WWII. We did not ride in on this white horse to save the day. However, Donnie disgustingly buys into that very narrative.We didn t.MacArthur was already in the Philippines when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. In the ensuing months, he suffered grievous defeats. He actually ordered a withdrawal to Australia to regroup. He was human. His troops were human. Japan was a juggernaut at the time, and we couldn t beat them with brute force.What do you think of that, Donnie? MacArthur actually ordered a retreat. Isn t that giving up? Isn t that what you re railing against? MacArthur is remembered as great because of things like this. Not in spite of them, and definitely not because they didn t happen.Then there s Patton. He does seem to have been more the style that you see in your head. For instance, he s reported to have said: We shall attack and attack until we are exhausted, and then we shall attack again. Yet he was surrounded by controversy over his leadership methods. Congress and the military actually demanded his removal from command after he slapped a soldier who was suffering from battle fatigue. There were other such incidents, too, but his qualifications are what kept him in the field. He might have stormed through battle zones like Bastogne (do you even know which battle that was, Donnie?), ending them, but he was far from perfect.Donnie, all you do is talk about winning and losing, and yet, nobody has ever conceded defeat to ISIS. Nobody in U.S. leadership has said,  We can t beat ISIS.  Not our president, not our current commanders. A coach telling his football team  We can t do this,  hands the game to the other team. Our military doesn t operate like that, however. It never has. It operates with the understanding that there will be defeats. Learning from those defeats is key to beating ISIS   something you would know if you weren t such a conceited bastard.On the ground, unit commanders, all the way down to squad leaders, will give pep talks. Yes, that is normal, and you and I both know it. However, those who are guiding the entire war have to be realistic, or they will end up losing it, and they know it.It s not a football game.ISIS is not WWII, and it s definitely not a game, Donnie. Your treating it as such doesn t just show astonishing arrogance, but it also shows that you re wholly unqualified to be the Commander in Chief of the U.S. military. You will never be able to understand how anything works as long as you keep treating everything as winning versus losing.As though it s a goddamn football game. It s not.
