40907,COMEY RESPONDS TO FIRING…What He Said Will Make Liberal Heads Explode,"Since the moment word got out about the firing of FBI Director James Comey, Democrats and their allies in the leftist media have been falling all over themselves to spew their hatred towards Trump and his unfair firing of James Comey. Even though for months, Democrats and the leftist media have been outraged at Comey for the reopening of the FBI investigation into Hillary s e-mails just prior to the election, all is forgiven now. It s time for the media and the Democrats to come together, regroup and focus on the real target President Trump.But now, FBI Director James Comey has made a statement about the firing, and it s not exactly what the media was hoping for. Comey took the high road when he sent a letter on Wednesday to agents and friends regarding President Trump s firing of him the day before. I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI director for any reason, or for no reason at all,  he wrote, according to CNN.  I m not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed,  Comey added. I hope you won t either. It is done, and I will be fine, although I will miss you and the mission deeply.  -The HillWatch MSNBC s  Morning Joe  hacks Mika Brzezinski and fake conservative Joe Scarborough attempt to trash Trump s reasoning for firing Comey.

63440,"To get around Congress, Obama turns to city halls","WASHINGTON — President Obama has quietly racked up a series of legislative victories during the past few months as lawmakers have enthusiastically embraced his calls for a higher minimum wage, paid sick leave and universal pre-kindergarten.

Instead of Capitol Hill, those victories happened in city halls, state houses and county buildings far from Washington.

At least six major cities — Chicago, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Tacoma, Wash., and Washington, D.C. — have passed paid sick leave laws in the four months since Obama called for state and local action in this year's State of the Union Address. Since the 2013 address when Obama called for an increase in the minimum wage, 17 states and six major cities have taken action, including Los Angeles last week.

Obama's state-and-local strategy may be unprecedented in its scope and ambition. Though previous administrations have appointed top advisers to listen to concerns of state and local officials, the Obama White House appears to be the first to aggressively use those same channels to encourage them to adopt Obama's policies.

""It is a change in the paradigm, where we used to sit passively by waiting for elected officials to come to us. We think we can have a more substantial impact if we collaborate,"" said Valerie Jarrett, the assistant to the president for public engagement and intergovernmental affairs.

""I think the president has always had the perspective that change always happens from the ground up, and our state and local officials are oftentimes more influenced by the will of the American people than the politics in Washington would seem to indicate,"" Jarrett said in an interview.

Obama has no formal authority over state and local lawmakers, so his persuasion is a form of soft power — the ""phone"" part of what Obama has described as a ""pen-and-phone"" strategy to take action in the absence of congressional cooperation.

He's found fertile ground in Democratic-run cities such as Seattle, where Mayor Ed Murray helped push for a minimum wage and paid leave laws that have gone into effect since April.

""President Obama recognizes that good ideas are being incubated at the local level, and those are ideas that are going to go to scale nationally,"" Murray said. That recognition can go a long way in a city such as Seattle, which often doesn't get the national attention East Coast cities do. ""The president of the United States recognizing us only helps us. We do other things beside e-commerce and coffee,"" Murray said.

There's also resistance. Jon Russell is a councilman in Culpeper, Va., and the director of the American City County Exchange, a year-old initiative of the small-government American Legislative Exchange Council.

Russell said states — not cities, not Congress and not the president — should be the primary regulator of labor conditions. Obama, he said, is ""hop-skipping over the states.""

""With the number of states that have now turned to the opposite political party, he doesn't have the allies there that he used to,"" Russell said. ""To work with the urban areas to push his agenda is not surprising. It's the only allies he really has.""

The strategy has been more effective on some policies than others. Since last September, more than 200 mayors have signed on to the My Brother's Keeper initiative, a commitment to help boys and young men of color. But since Obama called for states to offer free community college in January, only a handful have moved in that direction.

The state-and-local strategy effort has been particularly effective on paid leave policies, which Obama championed in his State of the Union Address this year. ""Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave — 43 million. Think about that,"" Obama said. ""So I'll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own.""

That pledge came with a $1 million budget from the Department of Labor to help fund feasibility studies for state and local governments, which will begin to be awarded this summer.

Obama dispatched Jarrett and Labor Secretary Tom Perez on a ""Lead on Leave"" tour of cities that have adopted paid leave policies. Jarrett went to Philadelphia and Chicago; Perez has been to Portland, Ore., Pawtucket, R.I., St. Petersburg, Fla., and Seattle.

Tuesday, Perez will be in Minneapolis, which just adopted a paid leave policy for city employees this month.

Perez said it's a mistake to view the state-and-local strategy as separate from a larger effort. ""Our strategy is an all-of-the-above-and-then-some strategy,"" he said.

He said Obama will continue to use executive orders, as he did when he increased the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10 an hour.

""We want Congress to act, and I'm confident that it's a when question, not an if question. But we're also not going to wait around for Congress to act,"" Perez said.

Although focusing on city councils may seem small compared with the sweeping congressional legislation early in Obama's presidency, state minimum wage laws will raise the pay of more than 7 million people by 2017. (That number, which comes from the White House Council of Economic Advisers, includes people making just above minimum wage who were helped indirectly because their wages are increased accordingly.)

""That's nothing to sneeze at. That's progress,"" Jarrett said.

San Francisco passed the first paid sick time law in the nation in 2006, requiring all employers to grant one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked. Three states and 18 cities now have paid sick leave laws on the books, according to A Better Balance, a New York-based legal advocacy group that tracks such laws.

A year ago, advocates had a hard time breaking through the public consciousness on the issue, said the group's co-president, Sherry Leiwant. After a White House Working Families Summit last year, and again after January's State of the Union Address, there's been an ""explosion"" of interest by state and local lawmakers, she said.

""The White House leadership on this issue has been huge. It's had a real impact,"" Leiwant said. ""That influence on mayors or governors, who are Democrats but haven't paid a lot of attention to this issue, or they want to be pro-business Democrats, this gives them a lot of cover.""

A Better Balance still favors a national law that would cover everyone, but while the government is divided at the national level, ""the best strategy is to go to localities and states.""

A city-by-city strategy can be painstaking and legally complicated. Every state grants different home rule powers to cities — and even different powers to different-sized cities in the same state.

Philadelphia was able to pass a paid leave bill applying to private-sector workers, but Pittsburgh's law applies only to some non-union city workers. Pittsburgh City Councilwoman Natalia Rudiak credits Obama for giving her city's effort ""a lot of momentum,"" but she said more cities need to put pressure on the state Legislature to adopt statewide law.

There's also pushback from the opposite direction. Last month, the Pennsylvania Senate voted 37-12 to preempt the Philadelphia law, taking the power to regulate sick leave out of the hands of local governments.

That bill's sponsor, state Sen. John Eichelberger Jr., said it's untenable to have 2,562 municipalities with different labor standards, forcing businesses to comply with a patchwork of rules.

""Philosophically, I have a real problem with President Obama going to a municipality and trying to accomplish an agenda, whether it's liberal or conservative or otherwise,"" he said. ""It's just not the place to adopt these policies.""

Obama has opened an entirely new frontier of presidential power by turning to state and local governments, said Matthew Eshbaugh-Soha, who studies the effect of presidential persuasion at the University of North Texas.

""I'm really struck by, one, why hasn't anybody thought of this before? And two, this could be a very effective strategy,"" Eshbaugh-Soha said. ""At a time when executive orders are becoming particularly controversial and you're not able to break through the gridlock of Congress, I think it's ingenious.""

He's skeptical that the effort will put much pressure on members of Congress who don't support Obama's policies.

Jarrett said the effort is starting to snowball. She said some city leaders agreed with paid leave on principle but were reluctant to pass what could be seen as burdensome regulations in a difficult economy. As more cities and states have passed those policies, it's emboldened others.

""Success begets success,"" she said. ""What the evidence has begun to show is it's not a burden but an investment that is starting to pay off.""

Indeed, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter vetoed two paid leave bills in 2011 and 2013. But three weeks after Obama's State of the Union Address this year, Nutter reversed course.

What changed? Nutter said the economy was better, and the bill contained key compromises to accommodate small businesses. Nutter spokesman Mark McDonald said he was unaware of any role Obama had in getting the bill passed.

Bill Greenlee, the councilman who sponsored the measure, said Nutter ""completely turned a corner"" on paid leave when the president put it on his agenda. ""I gotta think that when the president mentions sick leave in his State of the Union, and if you're a Democrat and a supporter of the president's agenda in general, that's gotta have an effect,"" Greenlee said.

Nutter did make a symbolic nod to Obama's influence in signing the paid leave bill: He signed it with a pen Obama gave him — after the president used it to sign an unemployment compensation bill. The only other time Nutter used that pen was on an executive order raising the minimum wage for city contractors to $12 an hour.",0
51482,"""Nancy Reagan's Last Words """"Do Not Vote For Donald Trump""""""
","LOS ANGELES, Calif.  Former first lady Nancy Reagan, who died on March 6 at the age of 94, remained mentally alert until the very end, according to a private nurse, who told reporters Mrs. Reagans last words to her were, Do not vote for Donald Trump.

She watched all the [GOP] debates, said the nurse, identified as Althea Thoone. She was very alert and kept up with all the news and current events, especially about the election. She said no true Republican would cast a vote for Donald Trump.

She was not happy at all because I dont believe she thought Donald Trump was a real Republican. She took a turn for the worse after the [11th] debate when he started talking about his private parts, and all that other nonsense about Mitt Romney getting down on his knees.

During the debate held on March 4, Trump responded to Romneys public attack against him by saying, He was begging for my endorsement. I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees. He would have dropped to his knees.

Trump also alluded to the size of his penis during the debate, responding to a joke about the size of his hands told by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.

The so-called 11th Commandment, Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican, once espoused by Ronald Reagan, now seems to be a relic from the past, when a kinder, gentler political sensibility existed in Washington, at least between members of the same party.

He broke that commandment, and a few others too, as far as Im concerned, said Thoone, who became somewhat of a confidant to Mrs. Reagan in her last years. She remembered that crack he made about her not being very beautiful too.

I wouldnt say Donald Trump caused her to pass, because thats up to the Lord, but he certainly didnt help any. She couldnt believe what she was seeing and hearing up there. She would just look over to me and shake her head.

Thoone reports that Mrs. Reagan hoped to attend at least one of the GOP debates, but the strain of travel and her advanced age prevented such a trip. She was happy to see George H.W. Bush and former first lady Barbara at the Feb. 25 debate, says Thoone.

Mrs. Reagans last public appearance was on July 6, 2015, at her 94th birthday celebration.",1
31506,"For Obama, an Unexpected Legacy of Two Full Terms at War - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Obama came into office seven years ago pledging to end the wars of his predecessor, George W. Bush. On May 6, with eight months left before he vacates the White House, Mr. Obama passed a somber,   milestone: He has now been at war longer than Mr. Bush, or any other American president. If the United States remains in combat in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria until the end of Mr. Obama’s term  —   a   given the president’s recent announcement that he will send 250 additional Special Operations forces to Syria  —   he will leave behind an improbable legacy as the only president in American history to serve two complete terms with the nation at war. Mr. Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 and spent his years in the White House trying to fulfill the promises he made as an antiwar candidate, would have a longer tour of duty as a wartime president than Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon or his hero Abraham Lincoln. Granted, Mr. Obama is leaving far fewer soldiers in harm’s way  —   at least 4, 087 in Iraq and 9, 800 in Afghanistan  —   than the 200, 000 troops he inherited from Mr. Bush in the two countries. But Mr. Obama has also approved strikes against terrorist groups in Libya, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen, for a total of seven countries where his administration has taken military action. “No president wants to be a war president,” said Eliot A. Cohen, a military historian at Johns Hopkins University who backed the war in Iraq and whose son served there twice. “Obama thinks of war as an instrument he has to use very reluctantly. But we’re waging these long, rather strange wars. We’re killing lots of people. We’re taking casualties. ” Mr. Obama has wrestled with this immutable reality from his first year in the White House, when he went for a walk among the tombstones at Arlington National Cemetery before giving the order to send 30, 000 additional troops into Afghanistan. His closest advisers say he has relied so heavily on limited covert operations and drone strikes because he is mindful of the dangers of escalation and has long been skeptical that American military interventions work. Publicly, Mr. Obama acknowledged early on the contradiction between his campaign message and the realities of governing. When he accepted the Nobel in December 2009, he declared that humanity needed to reconcile “two seemingly irreconcilable truths  —   that war is sometimes necessary, and war at some level is an expression of human folly. ” The president has tried to reconcile these truths by approaching his wars in narrow terms, as a chronic but manageable security challenge rather than as an   national campaign, in the tradition of World War II or, to a lesser degree, Vietnam. The longevity of his war record, military historians say, also reflects the changing definition of war. “It’s the difference between being a war president and a president at war,” said Derek Chollet, who served in the State Department and the White House during Mr. Obama’s first term and as the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs from 2012 to 2015. “Being a war president means that all elements of American power and foreign policy are subservient to fighting the war,” Mr. Chollet said. “What Obama has tried to do, which is why he’s careful about ratcheting up the number of forces, is not to have it overwhelm other priorities. ” But Mr. Obama has found those conflicts maddeningly hard to end. On Oct. 21, 2011, he announced that the last combat soldier would leave Iraq by the end of that year, drawing that   war to a close. “Our troops will definitely be home for the holidays,” Mr. Obama said at the White House. Less than three years later, he told a national television audience that he would send 475 military advisers back to Iraq to help in the battle against the Islamic State, the brutal terrorist group that swept into the security vacuum left by the absent Americans. By last month, more than 5, 000 American troops were in Iraq. A furious firefight this month between Islamic State fighters and Navy SEALs in northern Iraq, in which Special Warfare Operator First Class Charles Keating IV became the third American to die since the campaign against the Islamic State began, harked back to the bloodiest days of the Iraq war. It also made the administration’s argument that the Americans were only advising and assisting Iraqi forces seem ever less plausible. Afghanistan followed a similar cycle of hope and disappointment. In May 2014, Mr. Obama announced that the United States would withdraw the last combat soldier from the country by the end of 2016. “Americans have learned that it’s harder to end wars than it is to begin them,” the president said in the Rose Garden. “Yet this is how wars end in the 21st century. ” Seventeen months later, Mr. Obama halted the withdrawal, telling Americans that he planned to leave more than 5, 000 troops in Afghanistan until early 2017, the end of his presidency. By then, the Taliban controlled more territory in the country than at any time since 2001. Taliban fighters even briefly conquered the northern city of Kunduz. In the bitter battle for control, an American warplane mistakenly fired its missiles into a Doctors Without Borders hospital, killing 42 people and prompting accusations that the United States had committed a war crime. Critics of Mr. Obama have long said his clinical approach to wars weakened the ability of the nation to fight them. “He hasn’t tried to mobilize the country,” Dr. Cohen said. “He hasn’t even tried to explain to the country what the stakes are, why these wars have gone the way they have. ” Mr. Bush was also criticized for failing to ask the American people to make any sacrifices during the Iraq war. But, Dr. Cohen said, “for all his faults, with Bush, there was this visceral desire to win. ” Vincent DeGeorge, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who collected the data on presidents at war, said Mr. Obama’s tone mattered less than the decisions he made. “Does the rhetoric a president uses at home matter to the soldiers who come back wounded or get caught in the crossfire?” he asked in an interview. Mr. DeGeorge acknowledged the complications in measuring Mr. Obama’s wars. The   phase of the Afghanistan war, for example, ended formally in December 2014, though thousands of troops remain there. For his analysis, he considered a state of war to exist when less than a month passed between either American casualties or an American airstrike. More so than Mr. Bush or President Bill Clinton, Mr. Obama has fought a multifront war against militants. Officials at the Pentagon referred to the situation as “the new normal. ” But for those who worked in the Obama administration, it made for an unrelenting experience. “As the Middle East coordinator, I certainly felt like it was a wartime pace,” said Philip H. Gordon, who worked in the White House from 2013 to 2015. Still, Mr. Gordon and other former officials drew a distinction between the wars of the 21st century and those of the 20th century. For one, Congress has not specifically authorized any of Mr. Obama’s military campaigns, let alone issued a declaration of war  —   something that it has not done since World War II. “War doesn’t exist anymore, in our official vocabulary,” Mr. Gordon said. It is not clear that Mr. Obama’s successor will take the same approach. The   for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton, has been more receptive to conventional military engagements than Mr. Obama. The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, has pledged to bomb the Islamic State into oblivion, though he has sent contradictory messages about his willingness to dispatch American ground troops into foreign conflicts. Military historians said presidents would probably continue to shrink or stretch the definition of war to suit their political purposes. “Neither Clinton nor Obama identified themselves as war presidents, but Bush did,” said Richard H. Kohn, professor emeritus of history and peace, war and defense at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “War goes back in human experience thousands of years,” he said. “We know that it has an enormous variation of definitions. ”",0
31006,Obama to Guest-Edit Wired Magazine - The New York Times,"It is perhaps only fitting that a president who rose to power by harnessing the internet would   one of the nation’s leading technology and science magazines on the way out. President Obama will take on that duty in the November issue of Wired, the magazine announced on Tuesday. It will be available on newsstands nationwide on Oct. 25, two weeks before Election Day. By Wired’s estimation, it will be the first time a sitting president has   a magazine, a move the editor, Scott Dadich, described as a natural choice, given the nation’s history of innovation. “When the founders wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, they were at the bleeding edge of enlightenment philosophy and technology,” Mr. Dadich said in the announcement. “Franklin was talking about crazy stuff like electricity and communications networks. Paine gave up the copyright to Common Sense so it could get wider publication. Jefferson was radically rethinking design and land use. ” At Mr. Obama’s direction, the issue will focus on the future, the magazine said. Its theme will be frontiers: personal, local, national, international and beyond. (Think precision medicine, urban planning, civil rights, climate change and space travel.) That theme will also serve as the subject of a White House conference, a convening of innovators, to be held in Pittsburgh earlier in October and to be   by the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. The president is no stranger to science, technology and Silicon Valley, subjects central to Wired’s coverage. His first presidential campaign is often credited to an effective use of big data and the internet. and he has championed several ambitious initiatives while in office, including plans to map the human brain and to get 20 million people subscribed to   internet by 2020. Last year, Mr. Obama famously dined late into the night at the White House with 13 guests, including Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn’s   John Doerr, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Vinod Khosla, a founder of Sun Microsystems  —   part of a broader effort to prepare an infrastructure and endowment that would be used for, among other things, a “digital first” presidential library. Mr. Obama also courted support from Silicon Valley professionals, some of whom were rewarded for their efforts. John V. Roos, a major   and a former law firm partner there, was appointed ambassador to Japan after Mr. Obama first took office. The Wired arrangement won’t be the president’s first foray into editing, either. In 1990, he  became the first black editor in the history of the Harvard Law Review.",0

If the two of them decide they don t want you running for office, you likely won t stand a chance The tens of thousands of emails on Hillary Clinton s private server from when she was secretary of state could also be on a second device or server, according to news reports.The FBI now has the only confirmed private server, as part of a Justice Department probe to determine whether it sent of received classified information for Clinton when she was the country s top diplomat from 2009 to 2013.Platte River Networks, which managed Clinton s server and private email network after she left the State Department, has indicated it transfer   or  migrated    emails from the original server in 2013, according to The Washington Examiner.However, Clinton, the front-running Democratic presidential candidate, has suggested that she gave the department 55,000 pages of official emails and deleted roughly 30,000 personal ones in January, which raises the possibility they were culled from a second device.Neither a Clinton spokesman nor an attorney for the Colorado-based Platte River Networks returned an Examiner s request for comment, the news gathering agency reported Saturday.The DailyMail.com on Aug. 14 was among the first to report the possibility of a second server.The FBI took the server last week, after a U.S. Intelligence Community inspector general reportedly found two Clinton emails that included sensitive information, then asked the FBI to further investigate.Platte River Networks has told news agencies that the server, now in New Jersey, has been wiped clean. But forensics experts still might be able to recover some information.There have been reports that some of the emails that Clinton turned over included classified information. Clinton maintains that she neither sent nor received classified data, which suggests the missives might have been marked after the fact as classified or with some other top-secret classification.The emails that Clinton gave to the State Department were on multiple storage devices. A Clinton lawyer turned over at least one thumb drive that reportedly included copies of the emails that his client has already given to the federal government.Clinton has maintained that she has done nothing wrong or illegal and says she will cooperate fully with the non-criminal investigations.Via: FOX News ",1

In a conference call with reporters, Gen. John Allen (Ret.) said: Trump’s remarks are not only uninformed…but it also directly undercuts the courage and the commitment of our troops. And I took great exception to this. However he feels personally about this operation, he should be encouraging our efforts publicly, rather than disparaging them. 
…. 
While [Trump] appears not to understand basic military activities, it’s not clear to me that he’s interested in learning them, either. Because there are a number of experts, who I think…would advise him otherwise. But he seems to be confident in his knowledge. And that knowledge, I think, reveals a lot about what he doesn’t know. 
…. 
This kind of rhetoric; this kind of disrespect for our military leadership; this absence of support for our troops who are actually in combat and support for our allies who are fighting and dying every day – it means to me that this individual is not qualified to be Commander-in-Chief. 
Military experts, like Gen. Allen, feel compelled to criticize the Republican nominee days before a presidential election because they feel like he is not supporting the troops and would be a danger to national security as commander in chief. 
Thanks to Donald Trump, the Republican Party has become the party that doesn’t support the troops. 
Republicans have gone from “real America” to un-American in record time. 
If a presidential nominee doesn’t respect the men and women who risk their lives for the country, then he definitely won’t respect the needs of hard working Americans.

The problem with the idea that the emails will save Donald Trump and the Republican Party is that Clinton was beating Trump while the FBI did their first investigation into her emails. Clinton has led Trump all through the Congressional hearings into her emails. She led Trump throughout the FBI investigation into her emails. Clinton won the Democratic nomination with her emails being a story. 
The point is that Hillary Clinton’s emails aren’t a big issue to the majority of voters. The people who aren’t Republicans in this election don’t care about her emails. 
When compared to Trump sexually assaulting women, not paying federal income taxes, and being sued in two states for fraud, the emails seem like a quaint political scandal from a much simpler time. 
There has also never been a shred of proof that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong. 
Republicans can’t get past the basic hurdle of needing actual evidence to back up their email conspiracy. 
Hillary Clinton is facing Donald Trump in this election, and only a moron or a truly desperate campaign manager clinging on the last bit of hope that she can find would believe that the reopening of an email investigation will make a bit of difference on election day.

16470,OOPS! OBAMA Tells Troops No Foreign Terror Attacks Happened On His Watch: Here’s Complete List Of RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR Attacks On US Soil During His Presidency [VIDEO]," In a speech at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida on Tuesday, President Obama declared that  [n]o foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland.  The claim earned perfunctory applause, but a closer look at the reaction of many of the servicemen and women there made clear what they really thought about the administration s handling of national security.Obama speaks to our troops at MacDill Air Force Base about foreign terror attacks on our homeland:The President s claim  which he has repeated in some form or fashion over the last few years  is an obvious rhetorical attempt to gloss over the reality of the threat of radical Islamic terror on American soil. The attempt to disconnect lone wolf  terrorists from the terror organizations who often inspire them does nothing to alleviate the pain of those who have suffered at the hands of jihadists and only hurts prevention efforts. Rhetorical tricks aside, the reality is that during Obama s tenure scores of innocent Americans have been murdered on U.S. soil by jihadists, most of whom were inspired by or acting under the direction of foreign terror groups, particularly the Islamic state.Below is a list of the major, verifiable radical Islamic terror attacks  successfully planned and executed  on U.S. soil since Obama first took office in 2009 (the first section provided by Daily Wire s Aaron Bandler): Little Rock, Arkansas, June 1, 2009. Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad shot and murdered one soldier, Army Pvt. William Andrew Long, and injured another, Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula, at a military recruiting station in Little Rock. Muhammad reportedly converted to Islam in college and was on the FBI s radar after being arrested in Yemen a hotbed of radical Islamic terrorism for using a Somali passport, even though he was a U.S. citizen. In a note to an Arkansas judge, Muhammad claimed to be a member of al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula, the terror group s Yemen chapter.Fort Hood, Texas, November 5, 2009. Major Nidal Malik Hasan shot up a military base in Fort Hood and murdered 14 people. Hasan was in contact with al-Qaeda terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki prior to the attack and shouted Allahu Akbar! as he fired upon the soldiers on the Fort Hood base. After being sentenced to death, Hasan requested to join ISIS while on death row. It took six years for Obama to acknowledge the shooting as a terror attack instead of  workplace violence. Boston, Massachusetts, April 15, 2013. Tamerlan and Dhozkar Tsarnaev set off two bombs at the 2013 Boston marathon, killing three and injuring over 260 people. The Tsarnaev brothers later shot and murdered Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier. The Tsarnaev brothers were self-radicalized through online jihadist propaganda and through a mosque with ties to al-Qaeda.Moore, Oklahoma, September 24, 2014. Alton Nolen beheaded a woman, Colleen Huff, at a Vaughan Foods plant and stabbed and injured another person. While Nolen s motives are unclear, he appears to have been another radicalized Muslim who was obsessed with beheadings.Queens, New York, October 23, 2014. Zale Thompson, another self-radicalized Muslim, injured two police officers with a hatchet before being shot dead by other cops. Thompson reportedly indoctrinated himself with ISIS, al-Qaeda and al-Shabab a Somali jihadist terror group websites and was a lone wolf attacker.Brooklyn, New York, December 20, 2014. Ismaayil Brinsley shot and murdered two police officers execution-style and his Facebook page featured jihadist postings and had ties to a terror-linked mosque.Garland, Texas, May 3, 2015. Two gunmen shot up the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, where a Mohammed cartoon contest was taking place, and were killed by a police officer. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack.Chattanooga, Tennessee, July 16, 2015. Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez shot and killed four Marines and a sailor at a military base in Chattanooga and was believed to have been inspired by ISIS.San Bernardino, California, December 14, 2015. Two radical Islamists, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, shot and murdered 14 people and injured 22 others at an office holiday party.Orlando, Florida, June 12, 2016. Omar Mateen, 29, opened fire at a gay nightclub, killing 49 and injuring 53. The FBI investigated Mateen twice before his rampage, but did not take any substantive action. Officials believe Mateen was self-radicalized but he pledged fealty to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi before his death.  The real muslims will never accept the filthy ways of the west, Mateen posted on his Facebook page after committing his heinous act at Pulse nightclub.  I pledge my alliance to (ISIS leader) abu bakr al Baghdadi..may Allah accept me, he wrote.St. Cloud, Minnesota, September 17, 2016. Dahir Ahmed Adan, a 20-year-old Somali refugee, began hacking at people with a steak knife at a Minnesota mall, injuring nine people before he was shot dead by off-duty police officer Jason Falconer. The FBI said numerous witnesses heard Adan yelling  Allahu akbar!  and  Islam! Islam!  during the rampage. He also asked potential victims if they were Muslims before inflicting wounds in their heads, necks, and chests. The FBI believe he had recently become self-radicalized. (As the Daily Wire highlighted, the Minneapolis Star Tribune attempted to blame  anti-Muslim tensions  for his murderous actions.)New York City/New Jersey, September 17, 2016. Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old naturalized citizen from Afghanistan, set off multiple bombs in New York and New Jersey. In Chelsea, his bomb resulted in the injury of over 30 people. Rahami wrote in his journal that he was connected to  terrorist leaders,  and appears to have been heavily influenced by Sheikh Anwar, Anwar al-Awlaki, Nidal Hassan, and Osama bin Laden.  I pray to the beautiful wise ALLAH, [d]o not take JIHAD away from me,  Rahami wrote.  You [USA Government] continue your [unintelligible] slaught[er]  against the holy warriors, be it Afghanistan, Iraq, Sham [Syria], Palestine   Columbus, Ohio, November 28, 2016. Abdul Razak Ali Artan, an ISIS-inspired 20-year-old Somali refugee who had been granted permanent legal residence in 2014 after living in Pakistan for 7  years, attempted to run over his fellow Ohio State students on campus. After his car was stopped by a barrier, he got out of the vehicle and began hacking at people with a butcher knife before being shot dead by a campus police officer. He injured 11 people, one critically. ISIS took credit for the attack, describing Artan as their  soldier.  Just three minutes before his rampage, Artan posted a warning to America on Facebook that the lone wolf attacks will continue until America  give[s] peace to the Muslims.  He also praised deceased al-Qaeda cleric Anwar Al-Awlaki as a  hero. Daily Wire ",1
60525,U.S. struggles to convince Iraqis that Washington doesn’t support ISIS,"They took out Saddam in two weeks, but they can t finish IS in two years?  asked Falih, another Iraqi who asked that his last name not be used out of security concerns.  It just doesn t make sense. 21st Century Wire says This latest report serves as a reminder of just how thin the US-led international game of supporting extremist militants has become.The most comical part of this story is how US military court scribes at the Associated Press are still in denial that Iraqis are harboring ill will against the US for suffocating (via crippling sanctions), bombing and destroying, looting and occupying their country over the last 25 years.Aside from numerous reports showing US weapons and equipment being dropped  by accident  and then used by ISIS, it s undeniable by now that the US have been the primary driver in fueling the rise and growth of this militant fighting group over the last 7 years.Associated Press writers are very careful to frame this narrative and advance the establishment s favorite meme that the debacle of Iraq was down to US  government incompetence , rather than inherent malice   even though history clearly demonstrates that malice has been omnipresent in US foreign policy for at least the last 70 years.SEE ALSO: 50 Years of Targeted  Kill Lists  by US Government Why can t they (the Iraqis) appreciate what we ve done for them?

Newspapers and TV networks repeat conspiracy theories that the U.S. created the jihadi group to sow chaos in the region in order to seize its oil.Skepticism about U.S. motives is deeply rooted in Iraq, where many still blame the chaos after the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein on American malice rather than incompetence Read more at Military.comREAD MORE ISIS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire ISIS Files",1
32359,John McCain and The Cancer of Conflict,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireThis week some devastating news befell John Sidney McCain III.On Wednesday, his staff announced that the US Senator had been diagnosed with a brain tumor called glioblastoma discovered during recent testing at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona.Since then warm wishes and tributes have been pouring in for the former Republican Presidential candidate. Both the US media and political establishment have closed ranks and are rallying around the Senator to help soften the blow.Putting previous feuds aside, President Donald Trump was magnanimous and cordial to the Arizona Senator, wishing him and his family the very best.  Melania and I send our thoughts and prayers to Senator McCain, Cindy, and their entire family,  said Trump.  Get well soon. Even former electoral rival President Barack Obama pitched in a little love for the 80 year old:John McCain is an American hero & one of the bravest fighters I've ever known. Cancer doesn't know what it's up against. Give it hell, John.  Barack Obama (@BarackObama) July 20, 2017Regarding McCain s diagnosis, we all can acknowledge the difficulties and risks involved with various cancer treatments, especially with brain cancer. Likewise, nearly everyone these days can attest to losing a friend, a loved one or family member to the disease.As with anyone suffering from this terrible condition, we wish the Senator well, along with a successful treatment and recovery.Still, McCain has a lot in his favor. Unlike most Americans, he will not have to worry about his medical care, and will be receiving the best cancer treatment money can buy, if not the best in the world, and with absolutely no expense spared. In this way, the Senator is extremely fortunate.And for those reasons, this is not an easy article to write. For fear of appearing too cruel in the face of his dramatic medical disclosure, one would be expected to suspend any political critique for now. Hence, the media has placed an unofficial moratorium on any negative coverage of McCain.That said, he is a special case.  As much as any political leader   he deserves to be panned, even under the present circumstances, because his geopolitical handiwork continues to cause havoc in certain corners of the world.Cancer Treatment in SyriaImmediately after McCain s major health announcement, the US mainstream media and Republicans began fretting over the prospect that his extended absence from the legislature might jeopardize his party s ability to pass legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare).With that in mind, maybe it s worth asking: how many innocent Syrians have been denied basic medical treatment, supplies and pharmaceuticals as a result of the harsh US-led regime economic sanctions imposed on Syria? This brutal campaign of collective punishment has been led by US Senator John McCain.Of course, the idea of sanctions as a form of economic warfare hardly registers in the West as being at all harmful to the population of Syria.  Sanctions? They re not against the people of Syria, only against Assad.   That s the general mainstream phantasm when it comes to sanctions, even though the official numbers show a vivid tale of devastation.One can only imagine how many among Syria s population of 20 million are no longer able to receive cancer treatment in Syria as a result of McCain s insistence on punitive sanctions. Before the conflict in Syria began in 2011, citizens were able to get free medical treatment including high-end state-of-the-art cancer treatment (consider that one simple aspect of this war, as men like John McCain still claim to be delivering  freedom  to the Syrian people by backing armed terrorist factions).Before the terrorist forces occupied the eastern part of the city, Aleppo was home to one of the Middle East s top cancer treatment centers, Al-Kindi Hospital. This is important because after McCain s secret trip to the Aleppo area in May 2013, the very same  rebels  he was cavorting with and supplying weapons to   the  Free Syrian Army  (under the command of Jabbat al Nusra aka al Qaeda in Syria) would later order the bombing on this cancer treatment hospital.Professor Tim Anderson explains the destruction of Al Kindi Hospital in December 2013, including the shameful spin applied after the fact by BBC and western mainstream media:In an Orwellian revision of events the BBC (21 December 2013) reported the destruction of Al-Kindi with the headline:  Syria rebels take back strategic hospital in Aleppo . The introduction claimed the  massive suicide lorry bomb  had managed  to seize back a strategic ruined hospital occupied by Assad loyalists.  Al-Kindi was said to have been  a disused building  and  according to an unconfirmed report, 35 rebels died in the attack . In fact, these  rebels  were a coalition of Free Syrian Army and Jabhat al Nusra, while the  Assad loyalists  were the staff and security guards of a large public hospital.Watch as McCain s  freedom fighters  in Syria drive a suicide truck bomb into the ground level of Al Kindi Cancer Treatment Center in Aleppo:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCwWgTUpGpE . How many Syrian lives were needlessly cut short as a direct result of that bombing carried out by McCain s own Free Syrian Army? For the cost of McCain s treatment at the world-famous Mayo Clinic, who knows how many Syrians could have received desperately needed treatment at Al Kindi or other similarly crippled facilities in Syria? One hundred, or possibly one thousand?Add to this, how many have died or suffer permanent health afflictions as a direct result of US economic sanctions which have crippled Syria s own National Health Service? One hundred thousand, or maybe five hundred thousand? One million? One day, those figures will be recorded and we will have the answer.The other piece of US legislation currently on the table which Republicans are desperate to pass is the $1-trillion US infrastructure spending package. Juxtapose that scene next to the systematic destruction of Syria s infrastructure by US Coalition and IDF airstrikes and destruction by proxy militant forces on the ground. Estimates for the cost to Syria range from $180 billion to $275 million. If the conflict continues past 2020, then these numbers could easily double.In spite of all this, John McCain claims to have no regrets about the damage that he and his fellow war hawks have inflicted on Syria.The Cancer of ConflictAt the same time that political figures like Barrack Obama dutifully respect the official Washington line on John McCain as the consummate  Vietnam War hero , very few in the establishment would dare to criticize the powerful Arizona Senator for his central role in engineering instability and violent conflict in foreign countries.John McCain sneaks into Syria illegally in May 2013 to meet with known terrorists, promising them weapons and regime change by way US bombs would drop in the Fall of 2013.. Americans should be reminded that more than any other single US official, John McCain has been the driving force behind the training and arming of violent jihadist and terrorists fighting groups in Syria, and that those same terrorists have slaughtered tens of thousands of innocent civilians including women and children in Syria and beyond   all sacrificed at the altar of a US-led geopolitical power play in the Middle East, and in the name of Israeli  security interests. Back in 2012, a delusional McCain, along with another dotty war enthusiast, Connecticut Senator Joe Liberman, insisted that the US needed to arm the  rebels  in Syria in order to  save lives.  Their statement read: The bloodshed must be stopped, and we should rule out no option that could help to save lives. We must consider, among other actions, providing opposition groups inside Syria, both political and military, with better means to organize their activities, to care for the wounded and find safe haven, to communicate securely, to defend themselves, and to fight back against Assad s forces. From the onset of hostilities in 2011, the bold-faced lie that McCain and partner Lindsey Graham have promulgated is that violent jihadists were nothing more than affable  moderate rebels.  That piece of Washington fiction has been widely discredited by now.Later on in 2015, McCain announced that the US should be supplying stinger missiles to the so-called  rebels  in Syria: We certainly did that in Afghanistan. After the Russians invaded Afghanistan, we provided them with surface-to-air capability. It d be nice to give people that we train and equip and send them to fight the ability to defend themselves. That s one of the fundamental principles of warfare as I understand it,  said McCain.Soon after that statement, thousands of US-made TOW Missiles were smuggled into Syria and used by terrorists groups under the command umbrella of Al Nusra.In her recent expos  for Trud Newspaper, Bulgarian journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva revealed the massive scale and scope of the illegal US-NATO weapons trafficking operation to arm thousands of terrorist fighters in Syria.Despite the overwhelming destruction in Syria and the abject failure of his policies, McCain has never given up on the policy of illegal weapons trafficking in Syria. Just this week, McCain, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, openly protested against the Trump Administration s latest announcement to bring an end to the CIA s failed program of illegally arming and training  anti-Assad  terrorists in Syria. Rather than admitting what everyone else in the world seems to know already   that the US  train and equip  program has been a debacle   instead he feigns defiance, while demonstrating a breathtaking level of ignorance by accusing the White House of being part of a Russian conspiracy: If these reports are true, the administration is playing right into the hands of Vladimir Putin.   Making any concession to Russia, absent a broader strategy for Syria, is irresponsible and short-sighted. When promoting their latest war, McCain is normally part of a tandem act, accompanied by his geomancing interest, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who arguably views the world through an even more deranged, albeit binary comic book prism: Breaking Syria apart from Iran could be as important to containing a nuclear Iran as sanctions. If the Syrian regime is replaced with another form of government that doesn t tie its future to the Iranians, the world is a better place. Like a world view gleaned straight from Ian Fleming s Goldfinger.In his seminal 2008 interview with McCain heading to the GOP presidential nomination, The Atlantic magazine s Jeffrey Goldberg asked,  What do you think motivates Iran? .  to which McCain replied: Hatred. I don t try to divine people s motives. I look at their actions and what they say. I don t pretend to be an expert on the state of their emotions. I do know what their nation s stated purpose is, I do know they continue in the development of nuclear weapons, and I know that they continue to support terrorists who are bent on the destruction of the state of Israel. You ll have to ask someone who engages in this psycho stuff to talk about their emotions. McCain s views on Iraq were even more disturbing, essentially surmising that the invasion and occupation was a good thing, and that we shouldn t have left because  leaving Iraq gave rise to al Qaeda.  OK. Admittedly, it s a bit counter intuitive, but it works for neoconservatives.These statements by McCain and Graham are not admissions made by normal well-adjusted individuals, but rather by cold, dark hearted sociopaths who generally view the lives of Arabs (along with Slavs, Russians and others) as necessary cannon fodder in the pursuit of military industrial profits for a select cadr  of transnational corporate  defense  contractors   whose interests Senator John McCain represents in his home state of Arizona; Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and the list goes on, and on.The geopolitical hubris doesn t end there, as McCain still maintains   even after 6 years of absolute implosion of his own foreign policy agenda   that removing Syrian President Bashar al Assad from power is still a  key pillar  of the US strategy for Syria. The administration has yet to articulate its vision for Syria beyond the defeat of ISIL, let alone a comprehensive approach to the Middle East,  said McCain this week.The reality, of course, is that ISIL/ISIS could have been defeated already had the US-led  Coalition  and Israel not illegally intervened in Syria territory. Far from doing much to  defeat ISIS  since they have invaded Syrian airspace since 2014, the US has conveniently stretched-out the  ISIS problem  through the extension of its own self-styled international mandate which was originally intended to serve as a precursor to the eventual break-up of Syria into federal states and ethnic cantons. This might explain McCain s rush to enact regime change in Syria before lording over the eventual break-up of the sovereign nation-state.All Things RussianThe other country which McCain is determined break is Russia. Vladimir Putin is a murder and a KGB thug,  crowed McCain on CNN last year, as he protested against positive statements about Russia made by then candidate Trump.Suffice to say, he, along with the boards of Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, are all extremely happy about NATO pressing right up against the Russian border in eastern Europe.But 2013 was indeed a busy year for the Senator stirring up trouble internationally. As part of his opening gambit against Moscow, it was McCain who was the driving force behind the US-backed coup d etat in Ukraine in February 2014   which ultimately led to a bloody civil war which continues to this day in the Ukraine. Apparently, this was McCain s way of  stopping Putin. His is a very dodgy track record; whether it s NeoNazis, or Jihadi Terrorists, McCain seems always ready to do a deal with the devil, and that s what makes him particularly dangerous.Below we can see McCain helping to whip-up Nazi-linked, neofascist street mobs in Kiev helping to bring the ensuing junta into power. Some mainstream US pundits have claimed that this never happened, and that it s just a conspiracy theory invented by  Russian propagandists  to discredit McCain. Unfortunately for them   it is true, and here is the photo to prove it:Senator John McCain (AZ) shares the stage in Kiev with far-right, NeoNazi Right Sector strongman, Oleg Tyhanbock, ahead of violent street protests in Ukraine in December of 2013, in advance of the US-backed coup.. Looking back at his erratic and flippant behavior, attacking nearly anyone who even suggested d tente with Russia or that supplying lethal arms to militants in Syria was a bad idea, it s no surprise that cognizant onlookers have questioned whether or not McCain is in a normal frame of mind.Frankly speaking, how could any one in their right mind be so consistently on the wrong side of every issue? How could any politician s judgement be that poor? Unless there was something else going on below the surface The questions didn t stop there. McCain s performance during a recent Senate Intelligence Committee Hearing on  Russian Influence in US Elections  was an embarrassment. Onlookers were stunned when McCain lost the plot during the hearing when asking former FBI Director James Comey: Well, at least in the minds of this member, there s a whole lot of questions remaining about what went on, particularly considering the fact that as you mentioned, it s a  big deal  as to what went on during the campaign, so I m glad you concluded that part of the investigation, but I think that the American people have a whole lot of questions out there, particularly since you just emphasized the role that Russia played. And obviously she was a candidate for president at the time. So she was clearly involved in this whole situation where fake news, as you just described it, is a big deal took place. You re going to have to help me out here. In other words, we re complete, the investigation of anything former Secretary Clinton had to do with the campaign is over and we don t have to worry about it anymore?  to which Comey replied: With respect to   I m a little confused. With respect to Secretary Clinton, we investigated a criminal investigation with her use of a personal email server. McCain then finished digging his own hole by responding: So at the same time you made the announcement there would be no further charges brought against then-Secretary Clinton for any activities involved in the Russia involvement and our engagement and our election. I don t quite understand how you can be done with that but not done with the whole investigation of their attempt to affect the out of come our election. It was clear McCain had no idea what was going on. At that point any reasonable person would have concluded that John McCain had in fact lost his mind   and was no longer fit to serve in public office.  In fact, 21WIRE made this very same case back in 2013 after McCain was caught playing video poker on his iPhone during a Senate Committee where lawmakers were debating the very war of which he is a chief architect. Here is the photo:As stunning displays of ignorance go, the video poker incident was one of McCain s greatest ever, and certainly should have been a warning to everyone that this man had no business making military decisions, let alone litigating war and peace between nuclear superpowers like the United States and Russia.Perhaps an announcement is forthcoming, but it s surprising after being diagnosed with brain cancer at 80 years old   why McCain has not yet announced his resignation from office?It s fair to say that while this Senator is being treated in the world s leading medical facilities, thousands of innocents will have died needlessly because of US sanctions and support for terrorists   all in the name of defense, energy and ever vast corporate profits. Strange as that might sound to some, for those who consider themselves members of a ruling elite and its mandarin management class, that is perfectly acceptable quid pro quo in 2017.After World War II, the military industrial complex and the international arms trade has spread conflict like a disease across the planet, metastasizing in ways, in places, and on a scale which no one could have previously imagined before. Undoubtedly, over the last decade, John McCain has played a key role in spreading that anguish. For the people of Syria, Afghanistan and the Ukraine, that will be his legacy, not the chimerical image of a  maverick  Senator or the  war hero. Once again, we implore the Senator to do the right thing by the American people and for those innocents around the world who have suffered at the hands of an arms industry whose interests John McCain represents Please, just retire.*** READ MORE MCCAIN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire John McCain FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",1
70937,Teachers Strike Allowing Children To Sample The Kind Of Free Time They’ll Have On The Dole,"0 Add Comment 
WITH 400 schools shut and 200,000 students not attending lessons, striking teachers have provided children with an insight into what their life will be like on the dole after they leave school. 
“It obviously wasn’t the ASTI’s intention, but it’s an interesting lesson for my three lads, sitting around on the couch, bored out of their holes thinking ‘is this it? Is this all I can do?’ That’s basically the dole like. Things being largely out of your control. Good to get training in early,” shared concerned parent Olwyn Nelligan. 
As youth unemployment remains worryingly high in Ireland at over 15%, teachers striking for better pay have inadvertently given their students a window into what life will be like post-second level education for many of them as despite being keen to learn and further themselves all they have is free time on their hands. 
“Teachers are striking for better pay, and if they were granted it, it would could serve as a way for the government to show it cares about education standards in Ireland and those who provide it,” explained one teacher on strike, pleading with the government to show the education sector the respect it deserves. 
A government spokesman did respond when we put the teacher’s concerns to them earlier today. 
“We. Don’t. Care. I thought that was pretty obvious. Have you not being paying attention to our policies for the last few years at all?” the spokesman responded. 
“Having said that teachers are the rock bed of the foundation of the first steps of a child’s life, blah, blah, blah,” the spokesman added. 
The government refused to comment on ongoing funding concerns with several IT colleges, or lengthy waiting lists for third level students wishing to access counselling services. 
Some 99% of the country was backing the ASTI’s bid to be paid for supervision work until they learned it may require an increase in their taxes in order to fund it.",1
26177,Federal Transgender Bathroom Access Guidelines Blocked by Judge - The New York Times,"A federal judge has blocked the Obama administration from enforcing new guidelines that were intended to expand restroom access for transgender students across the country. Judge Reed O’Connor of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas said in a   ruling, which he said should apply nationwide, that the government had not complied with federal law when it issued “directives which contradict the existing legislative and regulatory text. ” Judge O’Connor, whom President George W. Bush nominated to the federal bench, said that not granting an injunction would put states “in the position of either maintaining their current policies in the face of the federal government’s view that they are violating the law, or changing them to comply with the guidelines and cede their authority over this issue. ” The judge’s order on Sunday, in a case brought by officials from more than a dozen states, was a victory for social conservatives in the continuing legal battles over the restroom guidelines, which the federal government issued this year. The culture war over the rights of transgender people, and especially their right to use public bathrooms consistent with their gender identities, has emerged as an emotional cause among social conservatives. The Obama administration’s assertion that the rights of transgender people in public schools and workplaces are protected under existing laws against sex discrimination has been condemned by social conservatives, who said the administration was illegally intruding into local affairs and promoting a policy that would jeopardize the privacy and safety of schoolchildren. The ruling could deter the administration from bringing new legal action against school districts that do not allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice. “We are pleased that the court ruled against the Obama administration’s latest illegal federal overreach,” Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas said in a statement on Monday. “This president is attempting to rewrite the laws enacted by the elected representatives of the people and is threatening to take away federal funding from schools to force them to conform. ” A spokeswoman for the Justice Department, Dena W. Iverson, said the department was disappointed with the decision and was reviewing its options. In a statement, several civil rights organizations that had submitted a brief opposing the injunction called the ruling unfortunate and premature. “A ruling by a single judge in one circuit cannot and does not undo the years of clear legal precedent nationwide establishing that transgender students have the right to go to school without being singled out for discrimination,” the groups  —   Lambda Legal the American Civil Liberties Union and the A. C. L. U. of Texas the National Center for Lesbian Rights the Transgender Law Center and G. L. B. T. Q. Legal Advocates  Defenders  —   said in their statement. The ultimate impact of the Texas decision is unclear and is likely to be limited, legal experts said. For one thing, more senior courts in other regions have agreed with the administration that transgender students and workers are protected by existing laws against sex discrimination, and their decisions will not be altered by the Texas ruling. Also, the decision will not necessarily affect the outcome of other current cases. In the most prominent one, a federal court in North Carolina is weighing almost identical issues in suits brought by civil rights groups and the Justice Department that seek to block a state law requiring people in government buildings, including public schools, to use bathrooms that correspond to the gender on their birth certificates. Adding another major note of uncertainty, the United States Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a decision by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that required a school district in Virginia to allow a transgender boy to use the boys’ bathrooms. The Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction until it decides, probably this fall, whether to hear the case. If the Supreme Court does take the case and reaches a majority decision one way or another, then existing rulings by district and appeals courts could be superseded. If the Supreme Court takes the Virginia case but then is divided, four to four, on the issues, the Fourth Circuit’s existing decision in favor of transgender rights would take effect, although it would not be a nationally binding precedent. The Texas lawsuit, filed by Mr. Paxton on behalf of officials in 13 states, argued that the Obama administration had overstepped its authority in a series of pronouncements in recent years holding that discrimination against transgender people is a violation of existing laws against sex discrimination, including Title IX in federal education laws and Title VII in federal civil rights laws governing the workplace. In May, in the latest such statement, the federal Justice and Education Departments issued a letter to public schools stating that transgender people should be free to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities, and that schools that refused could lose federal funds. “A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use   facilities when other students are not required to do so,” the letter stated. The letter was quickly condemned by social conservatives, leading numerous state governments and school districts around the country to file lawsuits seeking to prevent the administration from taking action. The Obama administration, seeking to deflect the Texas lawsuit and another brought by 10 other states, argued that the directive was not a regulation or mandate but rather an explanation of how the administration interpreted existing   protections. But it carried a threat that the administration might sue noncompliant school districts and seek to cut off vital federal education aid. The states argued not only that the administration was wrong as a matter of law, but also that it had failed to follow legal procedures for issuing what the states called a “new mandate” that “harms school districts from coast to coast by usurping lawful authority” and jeopardizing “billions of dollars in federal funding. ” The Justice Department countered that the case was not suitable for litigation because the states had not shown evidence that they faced imminent harm, let alone a likelihood of success on the merits. If the administration brought action against school districts, the government and groups supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights argued, the school districts or states could make their case in court. “There is a multistep procedure before a state might lose federal funding,” said Jon W. Davidson, the legal director of Lambda Legal. “The government would have to specifically challenge a state, the state could respond, the government could bring a lawsuit, and then litigation in the courts would decide whether the government’s interpretation of the law is correct or not. ”",0
