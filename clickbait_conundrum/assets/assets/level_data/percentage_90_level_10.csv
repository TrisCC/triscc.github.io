59313,Only one-in-four Canadians support NAFTA ahead of 'Three Amigos' meet,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Only one-in-four Canadians say the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is good for their country, and more than one-third want it renegotiated, according to polling results released ahead of a North American leaders’ Summit on Wednesday. The survey from the Angus Reid Institute on Monday come as protectionist sentiment swells in the United States, where voters at both ends of the political spectrum question the economic benefits of NAFTA. The U.S. Congress is hesitating to ratify a new 12-nation trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which also includes Canada and Mexico. Trade has long been a focus at the so-called “Three Amigos” summits between NAFTA members, Canada, the United States and Mexico, held this year in Ottawa. The matter has also become a lightning rod issue in the election campaign to replace U.S. President Barack Obama, who wants Congress to ratify TPP before he leaves office on Jan. 20. Republican Donald Trump, his party’s presumptive nominee for 2016, has attacked the TPP and describes NAFTA as a disaster that needs to be renegotiated or shelved. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has also said she opposes the TPP. Angus Reid Institute’s poll showed also one-quarter of Canadians feel NAFTA hurts the country, while half were either unsure or feel the deal has had no impact either way.  The institute’s executive director, Shachi Kurl, said the survey contrasts with past polls on other trade deals, in which Canadians were more likely to support than oppose them.  “Is this simply a gap in policy makers’ adequately convincing Canadians that this has been a good deal?” she said. “Is NAFTA an exception in that Canadians see the specific trade deal as a bad deal? These are questions that we have to think on.” Kurl added the poll raises the question of whether Canadians are concerned about the effects of NAFTA in itself or whether their opinion is part of the global “grumpy view” on trade, citing U.S. anti-free-trade sentiments. Angus Reid said it conducted the online survey with a representative sample of 1,519 Canadian adults who are its members. The survey has a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. ",0
7124," Republicans Surrender To Trump, Fear Historic Loss Of Senate And House","The Washington Post reports that the Republicans and the billionaires that own them are more or less writing off the White House as a total loss and rushing to hold onto both the House and the Senate. They re afraid, and for good reason, that if when Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee, he s going to be crushed so badly in the general election that he ll deliver both chambers of Congress to the Democratic Party:The efforts are being driven by major players such as the Koch brothers  political network, which has already begun laying groundwork in Colorado, Ohio and Pennsylvania, along with the Crossroads organizations and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.The behemoth Koch operation   which aims to spend almost $900 million before the November elections   is now considering abandoning Trump as a nominee and focusing its resources on behalf of GOP congressional candidates.My colleague Korie Beth Brown wrote about how Trump is putting the heavily gerrymandered House into play and this move by the GOP Donor Class confirms it: Trump is leading the Republican Party to electoral annihilation.Hooray!According to WaPo, instead of dumping a billion dollars into winning the White House, the Kochs and their fellow oligarchs are planning to spend all of that money just to keep what they already have:A key element of the strategy will be a springtime wave of television ads that slam Democratic contenders and tout Republican incumbents as attuned to hometown concerns. Strategists hope the efforts will help inoculate congressional candidates against association with Trump s incendiary remarks. If there are crosscurrents that are potentially harmful, the most important thing you can do is aggressively localize the race   the things that matter back home, the problems you re solving,  said Steven Law, a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who leads the American Crossroads super PAC and a suite of related groups.While that sounds like a good idea, Republicans no longer actually SOLVE problems. Instead, they create them and then blame Obama and the Democrats. When your entire strategy has been unprecedented obstruction for 7 years, it s going to be hard to tout your accomplishments.Even with all of that advertising, it s going to be very difficult to get conservatives to be enthusiastic about voting with Donald Trump at the top of the ticket. Combine that with the abject horror that liberals and Independents will experience and you re looking at a huge turnout from the left matched against a depressed turnout from the right. And no, Hillary Clinton does not inspire the same kind of loathing no matter how loudly Bernie supporters insist she does.Republicans and their puppet masters have every right to be afraid of a blue tidal wave that will make the red wave of 2010 look like a drop in the bucket. The question then becomes: Will Democrats be able to hold on to both chambers for the midterm or will lazy Democratic voters throw away all of their gains again?Featured image via the laughably bigoted barbwire.com",1
56638,Blackwater founder Prince details meeting with Russian in Seychelles," (This version of the Dec 6 story corrects paragraph 3 and adds new paragraph 4 to clarify the nature of U.S. sanctions) By Patricia Zengerle WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Erik Prince, founder of military contractor Blackwater and a supporter of President Donald Trump, told U.S. lawmakers he had discussed U.S.-Russia relations during a meeting in the Seychelles with a Russian business executive with ties to the Kremlin, but insisted they did not discuss sanctions. In a transcript released on Wednesday of Prince’s testimony last week to the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, Prince said he and Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, or RDIF, met for about half an hour in a bar at the suggestion of officials from the United Arab Emirates. The RDIF was put on a U.S. sanctions list in 2015 because at the time it was a subsidiary of VEB, the Russian state development bank. While it no is longer owned by the bank, it remains subject to limited sanctions.  Americans are prohibited from providing extended debt and equity financing to sanctioned entities and their subsidiaries, such as RDIF. However, the fund does not raise debt or equity financing from third parties, according to a lawyer who represents the fund.  The House intelligence panel is one of three congressional committees and a special counsel investigating U.S. allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, and the possibility of collusion between Trump associates and Moscow. Russia denies attempting to influence the U.S. campaign. Trump denies any collusion. Prince was called to testify because of the Seychelles meeting on Jan. 11, 2017, which The Washington Post later described as an effort to connect the incoming Trump administration with Moscow. He met with the committee voluntarily, and did not have an attorney with him. Prince said he had traveled to the Seychelles for a business meeting with UAE officials, who included Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, and they suggested he talk to Dmitriev. “After the meeting, they mentioned a guy I should meet who was also in town to see them, a Kirill Dmitriev from Russia,” Prince told members of the House committee, according to the transcript.  “I didn’t fly there to meet any Russian guy,” Prince said. Prince told reporters after his interview that the panel had wasted time and taxpayer money on a “fishing expedition.” Prince donated to Trump’s campaign, made multiple visits to Trump Tower in New York and said he wrote some foreign policy memos for the Republican candidate, which he delivered to Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon. Democratic committee members noted that Prince said Bannon  had told him about a secret meeting at Trump Tower in December 2016 with UAE officials, shortly before the January Seychelles meeting. Prince said he had met Trump just once, at a fundraiser, before he was elected president in November 2016. Prince’s sister, Betsy DeVos, is Trump’s Secretary of Education. Prince said he had discussed U.S.-Russia relations with Dmitriev, but only in the broadest terms. “If Franklin Roosevelt can work with Joseph Stalin after the Ukraine terror famine, after killing tens of millions of his own citizens, we can certainly at least cooperate with the Russians in a productive way to defeat the Islamic State,” Prince said he told Dmitriev. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, said after the testimony was released that Prince had been less than forthcoming and sought to represent his meeting with Dmitriev as coincidental. “Prince also could not adequately explain why he traveled halfway around the world to meet with UAE officials and, ultimately, the head of the Russian fund,” Schiff said in a statement.

39229,Delingpole: More Climate Fake News From The BBC,"Yesterday I asked of lying liar climate ‘scientist’ Michael Mann: “Does anyone take this guy seriously any more? ”[But the question was a purely rhetorical one. I already knew the depressing true answer having just sat, fuming, in my car listening to Mann being given the red carpet treatment on a BBC Radio 4 science programme.  “Oh Professor Doctor Mann, Sir, may it please your eminence to descend from your radiant cloud for a few precious moments and explain to us mere mortals why your amazing and unquestionably brilliant new paper on global warming demonstrates you to be even more right about climate change than you were even in the days when you won your Nobel prize?” fawned and grovelled the BBC’s interviewer from his prostrate position on the studio floor. Perhaps I exaggerate slightly. But it would be fair to say that the BBC’s interviewer, Adam Rutherford, sought to leave the listener in no doubt that when it came to climate science the “Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science” Michael Mann was a respected expert of great insight whose opinions one could totally trust. Mann isn’t though, is he? Maybe in 2001, when Mann’s Hockey Stick was promoted heavily in the IPCC’s Third Assessment Report, it would have been legitimate enough for the BBC to quote him as a climate scientist of note. But that was 16 years ago, since when the Hockey Stock has been discredited to the point where not even the IPCC quotes it in its reports. And where Mann’s reputation has become so tarnished that Mark Steyn was able to compile and edit a   book called A Disgrace To The Profession, consisting largely of distinguished scientists from around the world explaining in lavish detail how utterly flawed, bankrupt and worthless Michael Mann’s climate science was. “Misleading” “Just bad science” “Very erroneous conclusions” “A crock of shit” “Excuse me while I puke. ”   …    . just a few of things scientists had to say about Mann and his work. But as we were reminded yet again on the BBC’s Inside Science programme this week, the BBC continues to treat this tainted and controversial figure with uncritical reverence. On the programme, his interviewer Adam Rutherford allowed Mann space to give a version of this week’s Congressional hearing on climate science so ludicrously biased towards the alarmist narrative it might have been scripted by Greenpeace. “We have currently as the chair of the House of Representatives Science Committee an individual  —   Lamar Smith  —   whose funding mostly comes from fossil fuel interests who rejects the overwhelming consensus of the world’s scientists that climate change is real and human caused and represents a threat. The hearing was intended to provide cover to Congressional Republicans and the current Trump administration who are trying to cut funding for climate science and who are trying to roll back the policy successes over the last several years in dealing with climate change and dealing with carbon emissions. ” “As the hearing went on every time the topic was about the substance, what the science has to say, my feeling was that the Congressional Republicans realised that they were on the defensive, that they were losing the argument because, after all, they are denying the overwhelming consensus of the world’s scientists. And eventually it got into the gutter where they were trying to discredit me personally and to talk about squabbles between scientists in a sense it was a confirmation that they knew they had lost the actual scientific argument at that hearing. ” “It’s a difficult period right now for anybody who cares about science. We’re about to see an unprecedented event next month here in DC where scientists are going to be marching in the streets  …    .I think it’s a recognition from the typically quite reticent and conservative scientific community that they have to speak out now, that there’s a threat to science and to scientists unlike anything that we have, in my view, faced in the past. ” None of this weapons grade bilge went even slightly challenged by Rutherford, who flagged his own concerns about the Trump administration’s approach to climate science at the beginning of the interview by describing it as “troubling” and “disturbing”. [Says who? Why? ?] Let’s not forget, also, that there were three other scientists with at least as much knowledge and experience as Mann who were speaking at the same Congressional hearings, only from a sceptical point of view. Might it not have been useful for the purposes of balance to get at least one of them  —   John Christy, Judith Curry or Roger Pielke Jr  —   for the BBC to hear from one of them too? In theory, this is one of the BBC’s statutory obligations. According to the terms of its revised Charter 2006: ‘The BBC must do all it can to ensure that controversial subjects are treated with due accuracy and impartiality in all relevant output.’ As Christopher Booker detailed in his thorough report for the Global Warming Policy Foundation The BBC And Climate Change: A Triple Betrayal  —   the BBC has consistently failed to do this in its woefully   treatment of environmental issues. Indeed, the BBC hasn’t just failed to remain impartial on the issue it has actively proselytised on behalf of the climate change scare lobby across a range of programmes from the hysterical reportage of its     Roger Harrabin on BBC Radio 4 news, to the doddery laments of its house Malthusian Sir David Attenborough, to the     of Chris Packham, to the rampant global warming alarmism promoted by its entire celebrity science team from Adam Rutherford (see above) to   pouty boy physicist Brian Cox and its     lefty comics Robin Ince and Daragh O’Briaiaiaan. All this would be absolutely totally fine if the BBC were a private subscription channel whose sole purpose was to reinforce the   prejudices of the liberal elite. But it’s not. It’s supposed to be for everyone. Even deplorables like you and me. In this regard it fails. And always will fail. Scrap the licence fee, I say. That’ll teach it.",0

25499,How to Pick the Fastest Line at the Supermarket - The New York Times,"You dash into the supermarket for a few necessities. You figure it will be 10 minutes  —   tops  —   before you are done and on your way home. Then you get to the checkout lanes and they are brimming with shoppers. Your plan for a quick exit begins to evaporate. But all is not lost. For anyone who has ever had to stand in line (or if you are a New Yorker, you stand on line) at a supermarket, retailer, bank or anywhere else, here are some tips from experts for picking the line that will move the fastest. That may seem counterintuitive, but data tell a different story, said Dan Meyer, a former high school math teacher who is the chief academic officer at Desmos, where he explores the future of math, technology and learning. “Every person requires a fixed amount of time to say hello, pay, say goodbye and clear out of the lane,” he said in an email. His research found all of that takes an average of 41 seconds per person and items to be rung up take about three seconds each. That means getting in line with numerous people who have fewer things can be a poor choice. Think of it this way: One person with 100 items to be rung up will take an average of almost six minutes to process. If you get in a line with four people who each have 20 items, it will take an average of nearly seven minutes. Those minutes add up. Richard Larson, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who is considered the foremost expert on queues, estimated that Americans spend 37 billion hours a year waiting in lines. Robert Samuel, founder of Same Ole Line Dudes, a New   service that will stand in line for you, said in an email that most people are   and tend to veer to the right. “This may seem sexist, but I prefer female cashiers,” Mr. Samuel wrote. “In my experience they seem to be the most expedient at register transactions and processing. ” A. J. Marsden, an assistant professor of human services and psychology at Beacon College in Leesburg, Fla. suggested checking to see if a cashier was talkative and commenting on every item being scanned. If so, avoid this line “unless there is no one in that line, in which case, just deal with the chatty cashier,” she said in an email. It is not just the number of people ahead of you, but their age and what they are buying that can make a difference, Professor Marsden said. Older people will take a bit longer because they can have difficulties that delay the checkout process, such as not understanding how a debit card works, she said. Also consider the number of different items they are buying, Professor Larson said. Six bottles of the same soda will go faster than six totally different items, some of which cannot be scanned, such as vegetables, he said. If you have no irregular items, such as produce, use a   checkout, Mr. Meyer said. “You’ll lose the human contact but gain time,” he said. Not all lines are structured this way, but research has largely shown that this approach, known as a serpentine line, is the fastest. The person at the head of the line goes to the first available window in a system often seen at airports or banks. Getting into a single line also provides a sense of psychological relief because it eliminates the choice of where to go and   about the best line to choose, said Julie Niederhoff, an assistant professor of supply chain management at Syracuse University. Still, most people prefer to take their chances with parallel lines  —   individual lines dedicated to a single cashier  —   even though most of the time they end up picking a slower line, Professor Marsden said. Douglas E. Norton, a professor of mathematics and statistics at Villanova University, said studies had typically shown that with three tellers, each serving his or her own line of customers, the wait time was three times longer on average than a single line leading to an array of tellers. So why is the less efficient parallel line model used at grocery stores? “Essentially, nobody wants a huge line of folks with full grocery carts winding (like a serpent) around their store,” he said in an email. If you find yourself in a line that snakes around a corner or where the cashier’s view of the number of customers is obstructed by a wall or a shelf, be prepared for a longer wait, one study found. The study, by Professors Niederhoff and Masha Shunko of the University of Washington and Yaroslav Rosokha of Purdue University, released in June, noted that obstructions hinder the feedback cashiers get from seeing how their work thins the line. Mr. Samuel recommended: • Always face bar codes toward the cashier. • When buying clothes, remove the hangers and pull the tags out for easy scanning. • Use the buddy system at the express lanes. Split the items so you each stay within the maximum number allowed and then get out the door quicker. To some degree, waiting is all in your head. Research has found that, on average, people overestimated how long they waited in a line by 36 percent. Customers are more concerned with how long a line is than how fast it moves, according to research by Prof. Ziv Carmon of the business school Insead and Prof. Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University. Given a choice between a   short line and a   long one, people will often opt for the short line, even if the waits are identical. The psychology of queuing has also found that waits seem shorter when you are distracted. Professor Norton recommended talking to the person next to you or reading the magazines in the store’s racks. “And try to lose the idea that you are cursed,” he said. “If you remembered the times when it actually went smoothly, you would probably realize that it evens out in the long run. ”",0

24540,Mexican leftist presidential candidate vows financial crime crackdown,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican leftist presidential frontrunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged in his manifesto to clamp down on financial crime, and tighten money laundering, banking and tax regulations if elected next July. Lopez Obrador, the 64-year-old former mayor of Mexico City and a two-time presidential candidate, on Monday unveiled his 2018 policy platform, vowing to boost infrastructure spending while preserving economic stability. In his 415-page manifesto, published late on Monday, the founder of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party said he would combat money laundering by tightening controls on the banking system, including tougher sanctions for public officials convicted of financial crimes, a new conflict-of-interest law and longer sentences for tax offenses.  Banks and financial institutions aren t victims, but rather those principally responsible for, and benefiting from, the total lack of control in money laundering,  the proposal said.  Lopez Obrador s plan also aims to ensure transparency in sworn-wealth declarations and to block the right to confidential information for people under investigation for financial crimes.    AMLO, as he is known locally, has sought to deflect accusations that he would pursue Venezuela-style socialist policies if elected, vowing instead to clean up the country s graft-stained politics. Mexico s government estimates that the drug trade, tax fraud and other crimes are worth at least 1.13 trillion pesos ($58.5 billion) a year in Mexico, with all of the funds susceptible to money laundering, according to a classified report seen by Reuters in October. The manifesto also gave details on Lopez Obrador s plan to scrap President Enrique Pena Nieto s new $13 billion Mexico City airport project, which is currently under construction.  Lopez Obrador s plan recognizes the need to ease traffic and delays at Mexico City s existing airport, but proposes preserving it while expanding a nearby military site. AMLO would add two runways and a terminal at the Saint Lucia International Airport in the State of Mexico. The expansion would cost 50 billion pesos ($2.66 billion) and take less than three years, resulting in five runways shared between Saint Lucia and the current airport, he said.  The document said this alternative would cost about one-third what will be spent on the new airport, which Lopez Obrador says would drain government coffers with maintenance costs. Pena Nieto s office said in a statement that cancelling the project would cause job losses and send a bad signal.   The macroeconomic risk for Mexico would be enormous, as it would be sending the message that Mexico doesn t respect contracts nor private investment,  the statement added.  ",0

52,"In Once-Tolerant Mosul, a Social Unraveling That Feels Permanent - The New York Times","ERBIL, Iraq  —   More than two years ago, a Christian farmer in his 70s named Mosa Zachariah fled his village near Mosul with, as he put it, only the pants he was wearing. He left behind his house, “tons of wheat” and a BMW. But now that his town, an early target of the Iraqi security forces as they advance on Mosul itself, has been cleared of the Islamic State forces, it is not jubilation he feels, but fear of what awaits him if he tries to return. He wistfully talked about his city’s diversity as something completely unattainable now. “In that time, the Muslims and Christians were like brothers,” he said. Musab Juma, a Shiite who used to live in the Mosul area, said he would not be going back, either. He relocated to Najaf, in southern Iraq, where he has a food stall and has decorated his home with old photos and antiques from his hometown. Yazidis and Kurds and Shabaks, other minorities that were once vital pieces of Mosul’s human tapestry, have moved on, too. And many Sunni Arabs, who make up most of Mosul’s population, say they will never go home again, even if that is where their parents and grandparents are buried. Before the Islamic State’s occupation began more than two years ago, Mosul was Iraq’s most diverse city. Its rich culture, stretching back to the ancient Assyrians, and reputation for tolerance made it a vital symbol of an Iraq that could at least aspire to being a unified and whole nation. Now, as Mosul’s exiled civilians watch the battle for their city unfold, the only thing they seem to have in common is the belief that they once shared a special history that can never be reclaimed. Some of that belief, but not all, was torn apart after the   invasion of Iraq in 2003, when many Christians felt threatened and fled as Arabs and Kurds fought over old animosities. Mosul, home for many former Baathist army officers suddenly tossed from power after the invasion, became a center of the Sunni insurgency and a stronghold of Al Qaeda in Iraq, the precursor of the Islamic State. “Until 2003, the Mosul community was living in peaceful coexistence, but after that, things changed,” said Jafar Khaleel, 46, who left Mosul in 2014 after the Islamic State onslaught. “The Sunnis don’t trust the Shiites. The Shabak cannot live with the Christian. This is what the American occupation left behind. ” Back then, there was a social compact for Iraq’s minorities that at least promised security in exchange for tolerating the tyranny and lack of personal freedoms under Saddam Hussein’s government, led by an elite class of Iraq’s minority Sunni population. Today, there is widespread nostalgia for that time, though it is not shared by most of Iraq’s Shiite majority, now in power. “For generations, life was normal there,” said Sabah Salim Dawood, 62, a Christian from Mosul. “In the factories, on the farms, in the offices, nobody asked, ‘What are you?’ ” Now there is a sense of unraveling that feels permanent. “A man cannot describe in words what he misses,” said Omar Ahmed, 29, who used to work in Mosul’s Health Ministry and is now exiled in the northern Kurdish region. Walking through a ransacked church recently in Bartella, a mostly Christian town at the edge of Mosul, reveals an elegy to what has been lost. Some walls have been burned others are streaked with Islamic State graffiti. A whiteboard on a wall in an anteroom lists a daily schedule for Islamic State recruits  —   fitness routines, weapons instructions and Shariah law lessons. Strewn on the floor are dusty reminders of those who once prayed there: Christian storybooks, copies of a “quarterly social  cultural journal” published by the Chaldean Church, a Santa Claus figurine, photographs of schoolgirls and a pink plastic rose. An old Iraqi tourist guide from the 1980s celebrated Mosul as a city whose rich history as a place of great Arab conquests important to the region’s   past that made it “a city of great importance. ” Its nickname as the “the city of two springs”  —   because autumn and spring weather are so similar  —   was a testament to the city’s livability. “Since 1969, a Spring Festival has been held every year in Mosul,” the tourist guide noted. “Flower processions and folk dancing by thousands of people from every walk of life bring much gaiety to the place. ” Moslawis, as they are known, have their own dialect, and jokes, many based on their reputation for being stingy, which goes back to a famine in 1917, when they suffered as the Ottoman Empire took food from the city to feed its starving army. The rest of Iraq is known for its generosity, but a common joke goes that the only time a Moslawi will invite someone in for lunch is during Ramadan, when everyone is fasting. Even so, the city is also known for its food, especially Mosul’s kibbe, flat bulgur wheat discs stuffed with ground meat that are famous all over Iraq. There is the abundance of cultural heritage, the remnants of empires: ancient churches, monasteries, tombs, shrines and an antiquities museum that is important not just to Mosul but the broader Middle East. Nearly all have been destroyed or defaced by the Islamic State. Putting the city back together socially is “going to take a very, very long time,” said Rasha   a Sunni Arab from Mosul who now lives in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, where she is a research fellow at the   Studies and Research Center and writes about her home city. “I think everyone is going to live on their own. The Yazidis are going to live on their own. Christians are going to live on their own. The Sunnis are going to live on their own. ” As a child, she recalls, her classroom had seven Christians, seven or eight Kurds, two or three Yazidis, one or two Shiites, and the rest Sunni Arabs. There were four or five languages spoken, she said, plus three religions and two sects of Islam. “That diversity you didn’t find anywhere else,” she said. Walking to school, she would pass by a winged bull statue from Assyrian times, at the old city walls, that has been demolished by the Islamic State. “I really regret now that I took them for granted,” she said. Perhaps most painful is seeing former friends turn into enemies. Muhammad Sayed, 26, is Shiite, so for him there was only this choice when the Islamic State took over Mosul: Leave or be killed. Like many Shiites from the city, he eventually moved to Najaf, a holy city for his sect, where he now bakes bread and sells it on the street. “The Islamic State destroyed my childhood and my memories,” he said. “They turned some of my friends into murdering terrorists, some of the friends that I studied with in primary school and high school, and I have the most beautiful memories with them. But they have joined the terrorists, and for them, I have become an infidel. ” The task of trying to stitch Iraq back together is immensely complicated. But for Iraqis who have been displaced, it all boils down to a single, simple human emotion. “The major problem in Iraq is dealing with fear,” said Falah Mustafa, the Kurdish region’s foreign minister, at a recent panel discussion in Erbil, about Mosul’s future. “It’s immensely painful to be betrayed by your neighbor. ”",0

52556,"Republican Convention, Hillary Clinton, Roger Ailes: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The second day of the Republican National Convention was shadowed by the first, thanks not only to the tough oratory, but also to Melania Trump’s speech, which contained passages that were virtually identical to some in Michelle Obama’s convention speech in 2008. Mr. Trump’s campaign and senior Republicans offered conflicting explanations for similarities in the speeches. Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, denying plagiarism, accused Hillary Clinton’s campaign of trying to draw attention to the issue. _____ 2. It’s official. Delegates in Cleveland formally nominated Mr. Trump. Tonight’s speakers, who are to focus on jobs and the economy, included two top Republicans who have kept Mr. Trump at a distance: the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Ben Carson Chris Christie, who was passed over as running mate, and two Trump children, Donald Jr. above, and Tiffany, also spoke tonight. Our live coverage is here. _____ 3. The Republicans’ convention, and the Democrats’ next week, is drawing out two familiar satirists: Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert’s unctuous commentator “Stephen Colbert. ” “The Late Show,” with Mr. Colbert as host and Mr. Stewart as executive producer, plans live broadcasts after each night of both conventions. So far, the idea has been good for ratings. Monday night’s program was the No. 1 broadcast   show for the first time in five months. _____ 4. Hillary Clinton is weighing a shortlist of possible running mates that includes Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, the retired Navy Adm. James Stavridis, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Our   experts have created an elections model that puts Mrs. Clinton’s chances of winning at 76 percent and Mr. Trump’s at 24 percent. _____ 5. Roger Ailes, the subject of a lawsuit accusing him of sexual harassment, is in talks with 21st Century Fox on his departure as chairman of Fox News, according a person briefed on the discussions. A consulting role at Fox News appeared a possibility. His exit or demotion would be a stunning fall. Mr. Ailes, pictured above as he started Fox News 20 years ago, turned it into a   cable news program and the leading media platform for conservatives. _____ 6. NASA scientists were so stunned by global temperatures that they pushed up their annual announcement by months. Every month so far this year has hit a global heat record. _____ 7. Wildlife experts have an idea on how to reduce the Northeast’s booming population of   deer, which pose an increasing hazard to drivers. Bring back the cougar, they argue in a new paper. The eastern cougar could prey on enough deer in its historic range to prevent 155 human deaths and 21, 400 human injuries, and save $2. 3 billion, over the course of 30 years. But it seems unlikely that people would accept the cost: an estimated one human death a year from wild cougars. _____ 8. Lawsuits filed by three states say Volkswagen’s emission deception went all the way to the top. The suits say the company’s current chief executive, Matthias Müller, was aware 10 years ago, when he headed VW’s luxury division, that Audis were not being outfitted with equipment needed to meet U. S.   standards. “The idea that this level of fraud could take place and involve so many people at such high levels of a major international corporation is appalling,” said Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general. _____ 9. The nation’s racial tensions are playing out in the entertainment world. Leslie Jones, a star of the   “Ghostbusters” reboot, left Twitter after trolls pelted her with slurs, threats and pornography. “I mean on my worst day I can’t think of this type of hate to put out,” she posted in disbelief. Twitter said that it was trying to rein in abusers, but acknowledged that it was not “where it should be on how we handle these issues. ” _____ 10. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for another attack in Europe: a    Afghan immigrant who used an ax on four passengers on a Bavarian train, got out and then seriously injured a woman who was walking her dog. The random nature of ISIS attacks grew more clear, as a regional Islamic group in Nice, France, said that more than a third of 84 people killed by a rampaging truck were Muslims. _____ 11. Finally, good news and bad news. The bad: A huge construction crane collapsed on the Tappan Zee Bridge, north of New York City, shutting down traffic on major highways. The good: No one was killed. “It’s a miracle that the boom fell across six lanes of traffic, cars that are doing 60 to 70 miles an hour, and not one car was hit by the boom,” said an official with the crane operators’ union. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.

68080,China jails former Tianjin mayor for 12 years over graft,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday jailed former Tianjin mayor Huang Xingguo for 12 years, after he took more than 40 million yuan ($6 million) in bribes to push through promotions and land approvals, a court in the northern province of Hebei said. Dozens of senior Chinese officials have been investigated or jailed since President Xi Jinping assumed power, vowing to root out corruption and warning that the problem threatens the ruling Communist Party s grip on power. Huang, who was also acting chief of the Communist Party in the northern port city, became its mayor in 2008, before being investigated on suspicion of corruption in September last year. He abused his power to obtain bribes of more than 40 million yuan ($6.04 million) in exchange for promotions and land approvals, the Shijiazhuang Intermediate People s Court said on its official microblog on China s Twitter-like Weibo.     The corrupt behavior spanned Huang s political career of more than two decades spent in several Chinese cities, from previous posts in Ningbo and Taizhou in the coastal province of Zhejiang to his time in Tianjin, the statement added.  It was not possible for Reuters to reach Huang for comment.  In January, the Communist Party said it would prosecute Huang, 63, for graft, following its announcement last September of an initial investigation. Huang had made  presumptuous comments  on government policy and had damaged party unity, the investigation by the corruption watchdog, the Central Commission for Disciplinary Inspection (CCDI), showed.    He was also found to have accepted gifts, traveled with an  entourage  and worked to further his career by buying support and giving jobs to friends. The court said its sentence took into account the guilt and remorse Huang expressed over his offences, besides his cooperative attitude and the evidence he gave investigators. Tianjin, about an hour southeast of Beijing, has ambitions to become a financial hub for northern China and is one of four  areas designated a municipality, along with Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, giving it the same high status as a province. In 2015, a series of massive explosions at a chemicals warehouse in Tianjin killed about 170 people, provoking nationwide anger that it had been built close to people s homes.  ",0

1362,Trade in focus at hearing for Trump's nominee as ambassador to India,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators stressed trade and other business issues when questioning President Donald Trump s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to India at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday, while expressing strong support for posting him to New Delhi.    Trump nominated Kenneth Juster as ambassador to India on Sept. 1. The 64-year-old, an economic adviser in his administration, also served as under secretary of Commerce under former Republican President George W. Bush. Known as an expert on India, Juster was praised by both Trump s fellow Republicans, who control Congress, and Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, although they raised some of the issues complicating relations. Trump, who campaigned on an  America First  platform, has forcefully expressed his displeasure with the growing U.S. trade deficit with India. He has also called for reform of the H1B visa system that has benefited Indian tech firms. Indian officials reject suggestions that Prime Minister Narendra Modi s  Make in India  platform is protectionist and complain in turn about U.S. regulations on products such as generic drugs and fruit. Senator Bob Corker, the panel s chairman, said he was frustrated with the slow pace of India s economic reforms. Republican Senator Rob Portman, a former U.S. Trade Representative, struck a similar note, saying he has  deep concerns  about market access in India for some U.S. products and services.  We need to continue pressing forward, make sure that India adheres to its WTO (World Trade Organization) obligations and that we can push the range of economic issues,  Portman said. Senator Ben Cardin, the panel s top Democrat, said India had not been as strong as it could have been in enforcing sanctions laws. Juster said he would make business issues a priority in New Delhi, but also promised to work with New Delhi on issues such as North Korea s pursuit of nuclear weapons, counter terrorism and working with India toward security in Afghanistan. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis held talks in India last week, seeking India s greater involvement in helping stabilize Afghanistan, as the Trump administration steps up pressure on Pakistan to do more against militants operating from its soil. Democratic Senator Chris Coons asked Juster about H1B visas, but he said he was not in a position to characterize the administration s current position. The U.S. mission in India processes more visas than any other. A vote on Juster s confirmation has not been scheduled.  Corker called him  extraordinarily well-qualified,  and said he hoped he would be confirmed quickly. Cardin praised his  incredible credentials.     ",0
59203,"In abrupt shift, Trump warms to China and NATO, sours on Russia","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After less than three months in office, President Donald Trump has abruptly shifted his stance on an array of foreign policy issues from the U.S. relationship with Russia and China to the value of the NATO alliance. Trump, who ran for the White House on a pledge to shake up the status quo in Washington, repeatedly lashed out at China during the campaign, accusing Beijing of being a “grand champion” of currency manipulation. Candidate Trump also dismissed the NATO military alliance as obsolete and said he hoped to build warmer ties with Russia. But at a White House news conference and in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, he offered starkly different views on those issues, saying his relationship with Moscow was souring while ties with Beijing were improving. He also lavished praise on NATO, saying it was adapting to changing global threats. “I said it was obsolete. It’s no longer obsolete,” Trump said as he stood at a news conference alongside NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House East Room on Wednesday. The reversals on Russia and NATO could reassure U.S. allies in Europe who were rattled by Trump’s overtures toward Moscow during the campaign. But the president’s talk of “bonding” with Chinese President Xi Jinping could sow confusion in Asia, where U.S. allies are fearful of a rising China. Trump’s apparent shifts toward a more conventional foreign policy came amid infighting within his administration that has lately seen a decline in the influence of political operatives, mainly his chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Six months ago, candidate Trump suggested he was eager for an alliance with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “If he says great things about me, I’m going to say great things about him,” Trump said last September. “ALL-TIME LOW” On Wednesday, however, Trump said he had growing concerns about Russia’s support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. “We may be at an all-time low in terms of a relationship with Russia,” said Trump, who ordered the firing of U.S. cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield last week to punish Assad for suspected use of poison gas in Syria’s civil war. While criticizing Russia on Wednesday, Trump said he and Xi had bonded during the Chinese president’s visit to the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where they dined together with their wives and held talks. Ahead of that visit, Trump had predicted “difficult” discussions on trade. The improving ties with Beijing were underscored when Trump told the Wall Street Journal in an interview on Wednesday that he would not declare China a currency manipulator as he had pledged to do on his first day in office. Trump, a former real estate developer, took office in January as a government novice whose foreign policy mantra during was a vow to keep America safe and build up the U.S. military. Christine Wormuth, former undersecretary of defense in the Obama administration, said Trump had a “steep learning curve” on foreign policy when he came into office but that it was beginning to even out. “He’s starting to have a more nuanced and deeper understanding of a lot of issues,” said Wormuth, now a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The evolving Trump foreign policy appears to reflect less of the influence of his campaign team and more the views of Defense Secretary James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, all of whom are deeply skeptical of Russia. Trump’ former national security adviser, retired General Michael Flynn, was forced to resign on Feb. 13 for contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the United States before Trump took office. The new tone on foreign policy comes as Trump has been trying to settle the palace intrigue inside the White House, where Bannon, former chief of the conservative Breitbart News organization, has been at odds with the more mainstream Jared Kushner, the senior White House adviser who is Trump’s son-in-law. In an interview with the New York Post on Tuesday, Trump offered only lukewarm support for Bannon. “I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late,” Trump said.

55318,Singaporeans protest against uncontested presidential election,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Hundreds of Singaporeans, most dressed in black, held a silent protest on Saturday against an uncontested presidential election this week in which applications from four candidates were rejected. Political protests are rare in the wealthy city-state but the election of Halimah Yacob, a former speaker of parliament, as the country s first woman president had led to some dismay over how other prospective candidates were rejected.  ROBBED OF AN ELECTION #NotMyPresident , read a banner at the entrance to the park where the protest was held, a venue called Speakers  Corner, which has been designated as the site in the city for people to air their views.  We care about the country and where it s heading toward,  said 22-year-old Anna, who declined to give her last name.  This is an issue that I feel especially strongly about,  she said, adding that the power of authorities  had gone unchecked . She said it was the first time she had attended a protest. If the election had been held, all citizens above the age of 21 would have been eligible to vote. Aiming to strengthen a sense of inclusivity, multicultural Singapore had decreed the presidency, a largely ceremonial six-year post, would be reserved for candidates from the minority Malay community this time. Of the four other applicants for the presidency, two were not Malays and two were not qualified to contest, the elections department said on Monday. Halimah had automatically qualified because she held a senior public post for over three years and was declared elected after nominations closed on Wednesday. The stringent eligibility rules include a stipulation that a candidate from the private sector should have headed a company with paid-up capital of at least S$500 million ($370 million). Organizers of Saturday s protest said it was silent as speeches that touched on race and religion would have needed a police permit. Gilbert Goh, one of the main organizers, said an estimated 2,000 people participated. Tan Cheng Bock, who lost the previous presidential election in 2011, said in a Facebook post:  It is not President Halimah as a person that Singaporeans are unhappy about. It is about the way our government has conducted this whole walkover presidential election.   Displays of dissent are unusual in Singapore, one of the richest and most politically stable countries in the world. It has been ruled by the People s Action Party (PAP) since independence in 1965 and the current prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, is the son of the country s founding father Lee Kuan Yew. In the 2015 general election   held months after the death of Lee Kuan Yew   the PAP won almost 70 per cent of the popular vote and swept all but six of parliament s 89 seats. It was the third gathering of so many people at the Speakers  Corner since the beginning of July. The annual Pink Dot gay pride rally drew thousands of people to the site on July 1. And in mid-July, a protest was held at the venue calling for an independent inquiry into whether Lee abused his power in a battle with his siblings over what to do with their late father s house.

56433,Donald Trump Jr.’s Skittles Tweet Fits a Pattern - The New York Times,"Donald Trump Jr.  —   a close political adviser to his father, Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president  —   posted on Twitter on Monday night an image of a white bowl full of   Skittles. The image came with this text: “If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That’s our Syrian refugee problem. ” Mr. Trump, 38, the candidate’s oldest child, then got an earful. Hillary Clinton’s campaign called the post “disgusting. ” A stream of social media users denounced it as both flippant and fearmongering, noting the infinitesimal odds of being killed in a terrorist attack by a refugee. Even the parent company of Skittles weighed in. But Mr. Trump’s comparison of men, women and children displaced by a horrific civil war to a chewy candy was hardly the first time he had been accused of poor taste. If his sister Ivanka Trump has become known for her polish and message discipline, he has distinguished himself by wading frequently into the shadowy waters of white supremacy,   incendiary language and conspiracy theories. Other political candidates and officeholders, including Hillary and Bill Clinton, have also had relatives attract unflattering attention. But rarely are those family members so central to a campaign. Donald Jr. Ivanka and Eric Trump  —   the children from the elder Mr. Trump’s first marriage, to Ivana Trump  —   all spoke at the Republican National Convention and have been key players in their father’s White House run. This month, Donald Trump Jr. invoked the Holocaust when he argued to a Philadelphia radio station that the news media gave Mrs. Clinton a pass on “every indiscrepancy. ” If Republicans had done what she had, he said, “they’d be warming up the gas chamber right now. ” (He later claimed this was a reference to capital punishment.) He recently shared a Twitter post by Kevin MacDonald, a psychologist who has written about “Jewish influence” for a website devoted to “white identity, interests and culture” and who has testified on behalf of a Holocaust denier. A few days before that, Mr. Trump shared on his Instagram account a picture showing the faces of his father, himself and several Trump supporters with Pepe the Frog, a cartoon character that has been   as a mascot by the “” an informal assembly of white nationalists,   conservatives and   internet provocateurs. “A friend sent me this,” Mr. Trump wrote of the image, adding that he was “honored” to have been included in it. The Trump campaign declined to make Donald Jr. available for comment, instead releasing a statement that echoed his derision of political correctness and applauded him for speaking “the truth. ” His allies and friends came to his defense. “It’s remarkable to me to see the level of outrage about a metaphor used by Don Jr. ,” the Republican   nominee, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, said in an interview with NBC News. Todd Silverman, a friend from the University of Pennsylvania, said Mr. Trump “is not  . ” Told about the Twitter accounts Mr. Trump had echoed and his “gas chamber” remark, Mr. Silverman, who is Jewish, said only, “That is not consistent with the person I know. ” Mr. Trump and his siblings have appeared at rallies and advised their father, who has generally eschewed traditional political consultants, on strategy. The elder Mr. Trump, a   supporter, often mentions that his sons are avid hunters. Donald Jr. and Eric invited journalists to watch them hunt pheasants in Iowa before the caucuses there, and Donald Jr. once posed holding the tail of a dead elephant and other animals killed during an African safari. The siblings have also taken out big game within their father’s campaign: They pushed successfully to oust his onetime campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Donald Jr. also has a big role in the family business, as an executive vice president whose portfolio includes expanding the company’s real estate, retail, hotel and golf interests. He has also had a taste of reality stardom, appearing as an adviser on “The Celebrity Apprentice,” an iteration of his father’s hit show “The Apprentice. ” He lives with his wife and five children in New York, where he has flirted with the notion of running for mayor. “I like to keep optionality,” he said when asked on CNN if he would consider a run. The Trump campaign has called the scrutiny of his Twitter posts unfair. “We’re truly living in remarkable times,” said Jason Miller, a spokesman for the campaign. “The media’s run out of things to attack Mr. Trump on, and so now they scour the social media accounts of his family looking for things to blow out of proportion. ” Appearing this month on “Good Morning America,” Donald Jr. was asked by George Stephanopoulos about his use of the frog picture, which Mr. Stephanopoulos called a “  symbol of the white supremacist movement. ” “I’ve never even heard of Pepe the Frog,” Mr. Trump said. “I mean, bet you 90 percent of your viewers have never heard of Pepe the Frog. ” He added: “I thought it was a frog in a wig. I thought it was funny. ” Mr. Trump’s father has also employed his Twitter feed in ways many have found offensive. He has reposted messages from white supremacists’ accounts, and in July he posted an image of Mrs. Clinton, a pile of cash and a   star in the shape of the Star of David. He quickly deleted the post and said it was not intended to be   but he later said it should not have been deleted. Around that time, his son was retweeting   social media users. In March, Donald Jr. appeared on a radio show where one of the interviewers had had David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader now running for the Senate in Louisiana, as a guest on his affiliated show. The interviewer, James Edwards, is the host of “The Political Cesspool,” which has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as “racist and  . ” Mr. Trump’s Skittles post on Monday, which drew almost 24, 000 “likes” by Tuesday afternoon, seemed almost tame by comparison. Its argument is one that many have made, sometimes using MMs, against accepting Syrian refugees, and it is consistent with the Trump campaign’s talking point that Mrs. Clinton’s more inclusive stance toward refugees threatens Americans. In a year marked by anxiety over terrorist attacks, 53 percent of respondents in an Associated Press poll in July thought the United States should allow fewer refugees to enter the country, as opposed to 11 percent who believed more should be allowed in. The Wrigley company, which makes Skittles, was careful not to take a position on the matter, though it was clearly not on board with being seen as a symbol of it. “Skittles are candy,” a company official said in a statement. “Refugees are people. We don’t feel it is an appropriate analogy. ”",0
