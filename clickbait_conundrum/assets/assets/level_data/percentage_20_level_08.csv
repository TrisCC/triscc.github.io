7201,Clarion: Syrian Christian Militia Condemns Turkey for Bombing Kurds - Breitbart,"This story originally appeared at the Clarion Project:  By Ryan Mauro, The Syriac Military Council, a Christian militia in Syria opposed to the Assad regime, condemned Turkey for bombing its U. S.  Kurdish allies who are fighting ISIS. The Christians accused Turkey of continuing the genocidal and   campaigns of the Ottoman Empire. The statement reads in part: “This attack came at the 102nd commemoration of the Syriac Assyrian, Armenian and Greek genocide ‘Sayfo,’ while Turkey is continuing the same policies against the people living in the Middle East, trying to overthrow the democratic project that our people are working together to reach a political and administrational system based on pluralism, justice, equality and democracy. ” Turkey’s airstrikes killed 40 Kurdish fighters in Iraq and 30 in Syria. The Kurds in Syria belonged to the People Defense Units (YPG). The Syriac Military Council (MFS) and its female wing, the Beth Nahrin Women Protection Forces, are allied with the YPG Kurds in a U. S.  alliance named the Syrian Democratic Forces. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is a   coalition and it is leading the fight against ISIS as it prepares to attack Raqqa. Despite historical ethnic tensions, the   SDF was able to recruit so many Sunni Arabs that a top U. S. commander estimates that 60% of the fighters are Arab and 40% are Kurds.

52402,"""Собрал наглость в кулак и назвался писателем""","Общество » Практика » Как заработать В советские времена стать писателем было довольно трудно. Недостаточно было просто сочинить что-либо; требовалось добиться, чтобы сочиненное появилось в печати, и желательно не один раз, а потом вступить в профессиональный союз. Зато оставаться писателем было задачей довольно легкой — надо было только хранить свой членский билет и получать гонорары. О том, как обстоят дела сейчас , предлагаем вам узнать на примере писателя Александра Тавера. 0 комментариев 0 поделились 
Наоборот, в послесоветские времена стать писателем оказалось весьма легко: достаточно сочинить что-либо и истратить некоторое количество денег, чтобы услужливое издательство опубликовало сочиненное за авторский счет. Зато оставаться писателем стало делом довольно затруднительным, дорогостоящим и неэкономичным. Можно без труда вступить в любой профессиональный союз, которых расплодилось уже около сотни; членские взносы этот союз охотно возьмет, но на этом его полезная автору деятельность, как правило, и завершается. Членский билет такого союза лучше показывать только добрым знакомым — на остальных он никакого впечатления не производит. Гонорары практически не предусмотрены, особенно в периодических изданиях, где обязанности по заполнению страниц любым способом возложены на штатных сотрудников, работающих за зарплату. 
Выгоды писательского положения исчерпались, а расходы и трудности умножились. Короче говоря, если в советское время при встрече с человеком, которого вам отрекомендовали как писателя, возникала мысль: ""О, этот человек, наверное, многое от жизни получает!"", то в наши дни при встрече с таким же писателем возникает мысль: ""О, этот человек, наверное, многим в жизни жертвует"". 
Тем не менее, и в наши дни появляются отважные люди, желающие быть писателями и развлекать людей собственным литературным трудом только за скудные похвалы, без серьезной надежды на материальное поощрение. Интернет предоставляет им громадное поле деятельности. Каждый месяц сотни тысяч авторов наполняют блоги, чаты, форумы и странички в социальных сетях Рунета своими комментариями, новеллами, эссе, письмами и стихами. Тысячи авторов собирают эти случайные наброски в своих компьютерах и систематизируют их в надежде, что они пригодятся еще кому-нибудь, кроме непосредственного адресата. Сотни авторов, устав дожидаться востребованности, обращаются к издателям — и мигом получают на руки драгоценную книгу с собственной фамилией на обложке. И тут у них возникает вопрос: что делать дальше? 
Писатель Александр Тавер пытается найти достойный ответ на этот вопрос. Его книга ""Эскизы"", вполне прилично изданная в твердом переплете, распространяется как в бумажной, так и в электронной версии. Вопреки наивному мнению, будто книги за свой счет издают в основном люди пенсионного возраста, располагающие свободным временем и хотя бы небольшими накопленными средствами, Александр Тавер оказался человеком сравнительно молодым, энергичным и весьма уверенным в себе. Мы разговорились, я вкрался к нему в доверие, и он вручил мне написанную в третьем лице автобиографию, поразившую меня не фактами жизни, — они характерны для многих, а его отношением к собственному стилю. Недаром говорится: ""Стиль — это человек"". Интернет подсказал: эту крылатую фразу произнес французский естествоиспытатель Жорж Луи Леклерк Бюффон, когда его 25 августа 1763 года избрали в члены Французской академии. Ученый тем самым хотел сказать, что стиль есть неповторимая особенность человека, которая отражает его природные свойства, тогда как идеи, развиваемые им, могут быть достоянием многих. 
""Александр Тавер родился в 1977 году в Ярославле, но большую часть жизни прожил в Сибири, куда его семья переехала в начале 80-х. По образованию — прикладной математик. С 2000 года живет в Израиле, где, как и положено новому репатрианту, успел перепробовать целый ряд профессий и даже попытать силы в бизнесе, пока не остановился на профессии программиста. Он не планировал литературной карьеры, но его своеобразный, ироничный и легкий стиль письма неоднократно замечали люди, состоявшие с ним в переписке или читавшие его тексты, вроде заметок для школьных стенгазет. С этого все и началось — с писем. Получатели хранили их годами, перечитывали друзьям, и не раз Александру доводилось слышать: ""Когда ты напишешь книгу?"" Он в ответ лишь посмеивался: ""Да кому это нужно? Посмотрите на писателей и посмотрите на меня. Я рад, что вам нравится, но книга — дело серьезное"". В начале 2000-х он стал одним из множества блоггеров, и история с письмами повторялась: люди хотели больше, но все разговоры о книгах натыкались на тот же ответ: блоггер развлекает мимолетную публику или постоянных подписчиков, куда ему до писателя. Даже мутация блогов, чатов и форумов в социальные сети ничего не изменила. Он продолжал интересно и с юморком описывать забавные случаи из жизни, в том числе и своей собственной, иногда сочиняя что-нибудь забавное ради эпатажа. Гром грянул осенью 2014-го. Особенный гром, слышный только ему, заставивший остановиться и переосмыслить происходящее. Ответ на вопрос ""Кому это нужно?"" был совсем рядом. Его давно окружали сотни читателей, ждавших от него книги. Они говорили об этом открытым текстом на протяжении многих лет. Так пришло решение собрать лучшие из сочинений, подвергнуть, в меру сил, литературной обработке и издать"". 
Александру Таверу повезло, он слышал гром. Я перечитал ""Эскизы"" и никакого грома не услышал. Что ж, по-видимому, и в самом деле это был гром, слышный только ему. И я попытался уточнить некоторые аспекты этого явления природы дополнительными вопросами: 
— Вы полагаете, что написали действительно хорошую книгу? 
— Достаточно хорошую, чтобы быть изданной и найти благодарного читателя. Я могу сколько угодно считать ""Эскизы"" далекими от идеала и втайне стыдиться отдельных откровенно неуклюже написанных абзацев; но факт остается фактом — эту книгу перечитывают и с нетерпением ждут следующей. 
— Вы рассчитываете сделать литературную карьеру? 
— Скорее первые неуверенные шаги к ней. Каковы составляющие литературной карьеры в моем понимании? Быть востребованным читателями? Я достаточно востребован. ""Эскизы"" я выпускал для сотен, а сейчас меня читают тысячи. Писать хорошие книги? Я считаю, что книга хороша, если ее не только читают, но и перечитывают. Меня перечитывают. Обладать хорошим литературным стилем? Вот тут я вынужден в себе усомниться. Я считаю свой слог далеко не идеальным и постоянно над ним работаю. Все-таки писательство — огромная ответственность; не хочется являть пред очи читателя абы что. Само название сборника ""Эскизы"" символизирует для меня некую сделку с совестью. Я знал, что отправляю в редакцию далеко не идеальные тексты, и даже похвала главного редактора и чисто символические правки меня не переубедили. ""Считай, что показываешь людям наброски будущей картины. Просто сделай следующую книгу лучше этой"". И наконец, карьера подразумевает, что литература станет моей профессией. Я так же далек от этого сейчас, как мойщик посуды на кухне далек от поста генерального директора. 
— Что же такое, по-вашему, хорошая книга? 
— Смотря как оценивать качество книги. По тиражу? Но я видел книги, вышедшие тиражом в десятки экземпляров и намного более интересные, чем другие, издававшиеся сотнями тысяч. Может, по долговечности их оценивать? Хороша ли книга лишь потому, что она пережила века? Сомневаюсь. По красоте сюжета? Богатству языка? Жанру? Тут все зависит от индивидуальных предпочтений читателя. Если уж говорить о личных критериях оценки качества книг, то я считаю хорошими те из них, которые мне хочется перечитывать. 
— То есть все книги, которые стоят у вас дома, хорошие? 
— Вовсе нет. Нравится произведение или нет — труд автора я уважаю. Если откладываю книгу, не дочитав, ей всегда найдется место на книжной полке до тех пор, пока она не найдет своего читателя. 
— Имела ли ваша книга коммерческий успех или принесла только убытки? 
— Ни то, ни другое. Расходы на подготовку к изданию, иллюстрирование, создание аудиоверсии и печать первого тиража окупились, однако рекламная кампания издательства оказалась катастрофически провальной. Я потратил на нее больше денег, чем на все остальное вместе взятое, но на сегодняшний день издательство отчиталось ровно об одной продаже. 
— Получается, чтобы стать писателем, достаточно объявить себя таковым и заплатить издательству? 
— Даже менее того. Можно объявить себя писателем, не платя издательству и просто выкладывая тексты в интернет. Это так же легко, как объявить себя гуру или тренером и давать онлайн-советы. Можно представляться кем угодно и создавать видимость успеха в любой области. Интернет все стерпит. Но несоответствие образа действительности рано или поздно проявится. Гораздо важнее, кем тебя на самом деле признают другие. Люди, читавшие мои сочинения, признали меня писателем, как бы скептически я ни относился к такой оценке своего творчества. Когда накопилась некая критическая масса читателей, считающих меня интересным автором, когда у них появилось желание стать обладателями моих книг, я собрал всю свою наглость в кулак и назвался писателем. Разумеется, такое признание льстит моему самолюбию, и я много работаю над тем, чтобы действительно заслуживать это звание. 
— Состоите ли вы в какой-либо писательской организации? Помогают ли такие объединения писателю-новичку? 
— Я настолько новый человек в литературной среде, что еще не успел присоединиться ни к одному профессиональному писательскому союзу. Очень хочется присоединиться к союзу или литобъединению, подходящему мне по духу и открывающимся возможностям. Пока я лишь присматриваюсь к тем немногим, которые удалось найти, слежу за их активностью и мероприятиями. К сожалению, в Рамат-Гане, где я живу, пока не нашел ни одного. Очень надеюсь, что просто плохо искал, и на самом деле они существуют. Просто числиться где-то так же легко, как и объявить себя писателем. Я как автор, остро чувствующий ответственность перед читателем за качество своих произведений, выберу объединение, которое поможет мне профессионально вырасти. 
Живое общение с читателем, безусловно, идет мне на пользу. Не забывайте, что именно благодаря ему я и стал писателем. Как автору, мне всегда интересно выслушивать мнения о своих произведениях и узнавать о впечатлении, которое они производят. Оценки и толкования бывают разными, вплоть до диаметрально противоположных. Критика учит, а похвала вдохновляет на новые свершения. Юрий Мамлеев: можно ли прожить литературным трудом",1
29416,"FLASHBACK: KEY DEMOCRATS Call for Violence in the Streets…”March, Bleed, Die” [Video]","And we wonder why violence like today s shooting happened The left started with the violence during the 2016 and continued to escalate it once they lost. We have key Democrats calling for violent resistance in the streets Sick!Can anyone imagine a sitting Republican Senator calling for violence or fighting in the streets in opposition to a newly elected Democratic President? Speaking of p*ssies On Tuesday Democratic Senator Time Kaine told the Morning Joe in an interview that Democrats need to fight the Trump administration including online and on the streets in addition to the at the ballot box.Partial Transcript:MIKA BRZEZINSKI, CO-HOST  MORNING JOE : So, broad question about the future of the Democratic Party, especially given your firsthand experience with what we ve all been through. There s so much going on here that we clearly see, you know, places where you   we can criticize what the administration is doing, but how does the party rebuild? How do you prevent overreach in a situation like this? How do you prevent a continuation of the bubble in a situation like this, and how does the party reclaim its reach across the country while fighting these battles? SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): So, the way we get outside the bubble is we take advantage of this tremendous public outcry against the administration. What we ve got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box, and now there s the momentum to be able to do this. And we re not afraid of the popular outcry, we re energized by it and that s going to help us do our job and do it better.  -GPListen to faux man Tim Kaine call for fighting on the streets here. Pay special attention to his comment about the  Women s March  that  was organized under a grassroots  label.'  It sounds like Kaine s admitting that it was organized under a grassroots  label  but that it wasn t really grassroots at all. Why didn t he just come out and admit that it was organized by Soros, Obama and Planned Parenthood?Obama s former AG Loretta Lynch released a video that s a call to action for Democrats. These people who have been stripped of power after being so close to achieving their goals of fundamentally transforming America into something most Americans wouldn t recognize, are serious about starting a civil war in our nation. If you don t believe me, listen to the words of Obama s former AG, who compares the fight against President Trump and his supporters to that of the Civil War:  I know that this is a time of great fear and uncertainty for so many people. I know it s a time of concern for people, who see our rights being assailed, being trampled on and even being rolled back. I know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our Founding Fathers. (Lynch s statement about the Founding Fathers is quite ironic, considering that she worked hand-in-hand with former President Barack Obama to destroy the very fabric of our Constitution.) It has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals who have made the difference. They ve marched, they ve bled and yes, some of them died. This is hard. Every good thing is. We have done this before. We can do this again. We could also add the DNC s California Chair: In a sign of the vigor of the party s distaste for the president, outgoing party Chair John Burton, a longtime Democratic lawmaker and powerbroker known for his blunt and profane manner, extended two middle fingers in the air as the crowd cheered and joined him. F  Donald Trump,  he said:Outgoing @ca_dem chair @Johnburton gets standing O w final words to his party, finger upraised:  F@ck Donald Trump!  pic.twitter.com/VIqNQlhDJc  Carla Marinucci (@cmarinucci) May 20, 2017And we thought Tom Perez was bad: Tom Perez must not have taken the class about winning friends and influencing people. How can you win over voters with such bitterness and anger? The Democrat Party has sunk to a new low with this classless thug. Who goes out there and speaks like this? We reported (see below) on the last speech Perez gave and he said the same nasty things. What gives? Are the deems so desperate that they re now resorting to profanity-filled speeches that make false claims about Republicans and President Trump? We think it s a losing strategy!",1
62579,SPINELESS GOP PROVES MAJORITY Means Nothing …Senator Schumer Brags About Not Funding Border Wall: “Budget Deal Reflects Democrats’ Principles”,"Wow! Republicans had a chance to stand up to the Democrats and fight for the border wall, as well as other issues that got President Trump and many Republican members of Congress elected. The swamp monsters first attempt at backing our president and his efforts to make America Great Again however, proved to be an epic failure. Meanwhile, Democrats who are the minority party in both the House and Senate are gloating over the power they still wield over our spineless leadership in the GOP Top Capitol Hill negotiators reached an agreement on a huge $1 trillion-plus spending bill that avoids a government shutdown, aides said on Sunday.The deal means virtually all the day-to-day-operations of the federal government will be funded until September.It was a victory for Trump, who got an extra $15billion to strengthen the military and another $1.5billion to enhance border security.However, he lost out on the funding he needed for the US-Mexico-border wall, a promise that was one of the cornerstones of his presidential campaign.Details of the agreement were expected to be made public Sunday night, said aides to lawmakers involved in weeks of negotiations. The House and Senate had until midnight Friday to pass a measure to avert a government shutdown.  Daily Mail White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said earlier in April that the shutdown fight was  the first real test of whether or not the Democrats   specifically in the Senate   are interested in negotiating, interested in compromising. The White House last week dropped its demand for immediate funding for the border wall after Democrats said it would result in a government shutdown because they would not vote for any bill that included it. The White House also dropped its threat to stop paying federal subsidies to insurance companies that offer lower-cost coverage to low-income Americans. Trump had threatened to stop paying the subsidies to force Democrats to support legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.Here s a look at the trillion dollar budget that was passed by Republican majority Congress and Democrat minority.  We ve highlighted budget items where Democrats and RINO s in Congress came together to vote against promises President Trump made to voters who elected him.  Once those two major stumbling blocks to a deal were removed, negotiators had just a few remaining issues to resolve over the weekend.While Republicans hold majorities in the House and Senate, the GOP needs Democratic votes in both chambers to pass the funding bill. In the closely divided Senate, the GOP has a slim majority of 52 seats in a chamber where 60 votes are required to pass the legislation. In the House, Republican leaders need help from Democrats because some conservatives will oppose any bill that increases spending.Democrats used that leverage to get concessions from the White House on the border wall and Obamacare while also getting extra money for medical research and other domestic programs. At the same time, Democrats agreed to beef up defense and border security, allowing the White House to claim at least a partial victory.   USA Today",1
2955,Netflix Casts a Wider Net for Original Documentaries - The New York Times,"It was early in March 2015, the filmmaker Ava DuVernay recalled recently, when she was approached by Lisa Nishimura, the vice president for original documentary and comedy programming at Netflix, who asked “if I had any story I wanted to tell. ” As it happened, Ms. DuVernay had been thinking “about an overview of where the United States currently stands in terms of mass incarceration. ” By September 2016, the resulting movie, “13th,” opened the New York Film Festival. In January, after screening in some movie theaters, being made available free to some academic institutions and streaming on Netflix, the movie received an Oscar nomination for best documentary feature. “13th” was one of several pictures produced by streaming services to make it to the Oscars this year, but Ms. DuVernay (who was coming off an intensive Oscar campaign for her 2014 film, “Selma,” when she first spoke to Netflix) said that awards weren’t her concern when making the film. Nor could she pursue them after “13th” was out she had already begun her next film, the fictional “A Wrinkle in Time,” adapted from the Madeleine L’Engle book. She also didn’t make press junket rounds ahead of awards season. What secured the nomination were two things: the movie’s extraordinary quality and the perspicacious marketing department at Netflix’s documentary division. A couple of months back, I wrote about some of Netflix’s original films, lightweight comedies of varying quality. Several developments suggest a widening of the company’s ambitions in documentaries. The service began streaming the Sundance Film Festival’s Jury Prize winner, the dark drama “I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore,” a month after the movie won that prize. And, in what movie business journalists are almost unanimously terming a major coup, Netflix announced its acquisition of the rights to “The Irishman,” a   return to the gangster genre from Martin Scorsese, in late February. The documentary division, though, has been moving from hit to hit since the   series “Making a Murderer,” which, along with HBO’s “The Jinx” and the podcast “Serial,” gripped the public imagination with innovative approaches to true crime. Ms. DuVernay’s “13th” made the   lists of many film critics in 2016, and it wasn’t the only   documentary to be nominated for an Oscar this year “White Helmets,” about the war in Syria, actually took home a statuette in the Documentary Short category. Netflix also presented “The Ivory Game,” a Leonardo   exposé of elephant poaching. Flexibility of formatting is one component of this success story. On March 28, Netflix will premiere “Five Came Back,” about a group of prominent Hollywood directors and how they were changed by World War II, in three episodes. Mark Harris, the film’s screenwriter and the author of the book on which it is based (who is a longtime colleague and friend of mine) noted that had the project been picked up by a television network, “the directive would have been, ‘Please fill this   slot.’ Whereas with Netflix, the first thing they asked was ‘What should this be? ’” Ms. DuVernay recalled that Netflix’s commitment to making “13th” what she thought it should be remained consistent for the entire process. “After I started it, I realized that it needed to be about more than the immediate situation, and I wanted to add historical perspective” she said. “That meant an expanded budget, and expanded time. ” She noted that she wanted a      cut reduced to 100 minutes. “Lisa told me, ‘It can be two and a half hours.’ The   length was something I wanted. ” Ms. DuVernay added, “The division is filled with people who are real filmmakers, who have made documentaries, been in the editing room. ” What it looks like to the creator is borne in mind throughout the process Netflix’s goal over all, according to the filmmakers working with them, is to create distinctive stories. “In this line of endeavor, you hear about things like network notes, and that’s always a kind of vicious punch line,” Mr. Harris said. “We kept waiting for that moment, but it never came. [Netflix] was always constructive and supportive. ” Ms. Nishimura, the executive making all this possible, said she was lucky “to have come from a professional background that supports creators first. ” Before joining Netflix almost a decade ago, she worked with Chris Blackwell, the music entrepreneur who founded Island Records, at the indie film company Palm Pictures. When she joined Netflix, it was a DVD rental entity, and she was buying up titles and “overseeing relationships with creators worldwide. ” In the process, she discovered that audiences had a hunger for documentaries not always reflected at the box office. “Television ratings exist because of ads, which we’re free of, and box office has become so reliant on Friday night returns that it’s warped perceptions of what audiences want,” Ms. Nishimura said. “Just because a person doesn’t go see a documentary on a Friday night, it’s not a reflection on the film it’s just a reflection that maybe a documentary isn’t a film that a couple is going to want to see on date night. What we’ve discovered is that we can elevate storytelling and bring it to a global platform and create a cultural moment. ” (According to a Netflix spokeswoman, 73 percent of all subscribers  —   more than 68 million  —   watched at least one documentary on the site in 2016.) “Making a Murderer” certainly created a cultural moment, and “13th” did so on a scale that even its creators did not necessarily expect. “When we created it, we wondered whether or not it was a uniquely American story,” Ms. Nishimura said. “Really it’s a story of ‘the other,’ and how we treat each other as humans, and what can happen when that goes awry. And so it did get a response from a global audience. And will continue to. The docs live on our service forever. We’re allowing stories to continue to find their ceiling over time. ”",0
30851,Sleepy Behind the Wheel? Some Cars Can Tell - The New York Times,"It’s something that many of us have experienced while driving, though we may not like to admit it. It’s called a microsleep, a brief state of drowsy unconsciousness that can happen even if your eyes remain open. Drowsy driving kills. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drowsy driving caused 824 deaths in 2015, the last year for which figures are available. Several manufacturers, including Audi, Mercedes and Volvo, currently offer drowsiness detection systems that monitor a vehicle’s movements, such as steering wheel angle, lane deviation, time driven and road conditions. When drowsiness is detected, drivers are typically warned with a sound and the appearance of a coffee cup icon. But manufacturers and automobile suppliers are now working on advanced technological solutions that go beyond visions of coffee cups. To find out if drowsiness can be detected even earlier, Plessey Semiconductors has developed sensors, to be placed in a seat, that monitor changes in heart rate. Algorithms developed by the company indicate when breathing changes to patterns that are typical of someone who is sleeping, giving a warning before someone actually feels tired. “We could see this in a vehicle in five years,” said Keith Strickland, chief technology officer of the company, which is based in Plymouth, England. Bosch, a German supplier of technology to many automotive companies, is developing a   system that will monitor head and eye movements, as well as body posture, heart rate and body temperature. When such a system is used in vehicles that allow for limited autonomous driving, the vehicle could take over once drowsiness is detected  —   either coming to an emergency stop or pulling itself off to the side of the road, said Kay Stepper, Bosch’s head of driver assistance and automated driving. In addition, sensors on the outside of the vehicle will monitor the state of traffic in which the fatigued driver is engaged. Once vehicles can communicate with each other  —   a capability expected in the next few years  —   other cars will be able to take appropriate maneuvers to avoid the drowsy driver. In France, Valeo, another supplier of automotive technology, is developing an infrared camera system that will monitor children in the rear seat as well as the driver’s shoulder, neck and head movements, looking for deviations from the norm. Checking body temperature and even how the driver is dressed, the system will also be able to customize the interior temperature for each driver, said Guillaume Devauchelle, the company’s innovation director. Nvidia, chip supplier to Audi, Mercedes, Tesla and others, is developing the   an   tool that can learn the behaviors of individual drivers and determine when they are operating outside their norms. The system will eventually learn a driver’s standard posture, head position,   rate, facial expression and steering style, among other indexes. Based on a vehicle’s capabilities, the driver will be warned or automatically driven to a safe spot when conditions warrant. Until vehicles can drive themselves, it will be up to drivers to pull over once they feel drowsy. But drivers tend to make excuses, believing there is no danger because they are just a few minutes from home, or they are not really as tired as they may feel. “The more tired you are, the less able you are to change your behavior,” such as by pulling off the road for a short rest, said Mikael Ljung Aust, a technical specialist working on drowsiness mitigation technologies at Volvo’s Safety Center in Gothenburg, Sweden. To encourage drowsy drivers to take a break, Volvo, with a grant from the European Commission, is studying the effects of offering drivers free coffee once erratic steering wheel movements, lane departures and other signs detect that they are falling asleep, using the navigation system to direct them to the nearest coffee stop. Audi is faced with a unique problem because of its scheduled introduction next year of a car capable of driving up to 35 miles per hour without any driver intervention. When its Traffic Jam Pilot feature is engaged, the vehicle will need to determine if a driver is alert enough to take control after being a passive passenger for long periods. Through its Driver Availability Detection system, sensors will scan the head and face to ensure that the eyes are open and the driver is alert before the car turns over the steering wheel. Advanced drowsiness detection systems exist today. For example, Mercedes’s Attention Assist monitors a driver’s behavior for the first 20 minutes behind the wheel to get a baseline of behaviors. Then, the system checks those against as many as 90 indexes, such as steering wheel angle, lane deviation and external factors such as wind gusts and pothole avoidance. The system can currently detect drowsiness with 80 percent accuracy, said Christoph von Hugo, head of active safety for  . If drowsiness is detected, the driver is alerted to the nearest rest stop. For the past decade Volvo has offered its Driver Alert system. “To detect drowsiness, we study the car, not the driver,” said Mr. Aust of Volvo, looking at differences in the ability of the car to stay in lane, and other factors. The system detects drowsiness with 97 percent accuracy, Mr. Aust said. While N. H. T. S. A. reported 824 deaths in 2015 because of drowsiness, that number is likely to be considerably higher, the agency said. Drowsy driving can only be   and not measured like drunkenness. Also, drowsiness is not reported when it is a complication of other factors like excessive drinking. “We’re a nation of tired drivers. People talk about sleep deprivation as if it’s a badge of honor,” said Deborah Hersman, the head of the National Safety Council and the former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. “As a society we have to realize that drowsy driving is really dangerous. ” Until fully autonomous vehicles are a reality, “drowsiness is something everyone needs to worry about,” said Mark R. Rosekind, former head of N. H. T. S. A. and an expert on human fatigue. “Our tendency is to say we’re   when in reality we can fall asleep in a second. ” Still, the obvious solution for a driver who feels fatigued is to pull over and rest. According to Mr. Rosekind, studies with airline pilots show that those who took a nap for 26 minutes improved their performance by 34 percent and alertness by 54 percent, compared with those who did not. Regardless of how good technology is at detecting drowsiness, fighting off sleep is futile. Because sleep is a biological need, the best solution for drivers is still a   one: Pull over and take a nap.",0

In the following video, billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, his relationship with Bill Clinton, Alan Dershowitz, Prince Andrew and other famous names and their connection to a high-level sex scandal is exposed by Conchita and Cristina Sarnoff. The video (below) also looks at slavery and human sex trafficking in the modern world — and more. Lawyers for convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein touted his close relationship with Bill Clinton and also claimed in a 2007 letter to the Florida State Attorney’s office, that he helped start the Clinton’s family foundation. ( Source ) American Patriot reports: Jeffrey Epstein, the “billionaire pedophile” who was accused of keeping under aged girls as sex slaves on his private island, was long known to be friendly with former President Bill Clinton. The extent of that relationship, however, has never been made clear. But new records indicate the former leader of the free world was much cozier with Epstein than originally known. All aboard the ‘Lolita Express’: Flight logs reveal the many trips Bill Clinton and Alan Dershowitz took on pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s private jet with anonymous women Flight logs for Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane dubbed the ‘Lolita Express’ were published for the first time on Thursday They show that former President Bill Clinton boarded the plane with women believed to have been involved in creating underage sex slave ring Alleged victim Virginia Roberts says she was recruited as a slave when she was 15, and that she was forced to have sex with both Prince Andrew and Harvard law profession Alan Dershowitz The latter, she says, molested her mid-flight on the private jet Both the Duke of York and Dershowitz have fiercely denied their involvement in the ring. Records obtained by Fox News show that Clinton “was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender’s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the ‘Lolita Express’– even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights.” Original reports had Clinton on Epstein’s personal 727 only 11 times, however the flight logs obtained by Fox have him flying more than twice that amount. Fox News reports: “Bill Clinton… associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein, who everyone in New York, certainly within his inner circles, knew was a pedophile,” said Conchita Sarnoff, of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, and author of a book on the Epstein case called “TrafficKing.”“Why would a former president associate with a man like that?” (…) Official flight logs filed with the Federal Aviation Administration show Clinton traveled on some of the trips with as many as 10 U.S. Secret Service agents. However, on a five-leg Asia trip between May 22 and May 25, 2002, not a single Secret Service agent is listed. The U.S. Secret Service has declined to answer multiple Freedom of Information Act requests filed by FoxNews.com seeking information on these trips. Clinton would have been required to file a form to dismiss the agent detail, a former Secret Service agent told FoxNews.com. Virginia Roberts pictured with Prince Andrew, the Duke of York: Claims: Virginia Roberts says she was recruited to work as a sex slave for Epstein when she was just 15, and has named Dershowitz and Prince Andrew as two of the men she was forced to have sex with.

30453," NBC Gets Brutal With Donald Trump, Releasing The Video He Never Wanted Us To See (VIDEO)","NBC s Today show took the gloves off against Donald Trump on Wednesday morning, rolling a video compilation that will no doubt leave the vainglorious candidate red-faced with rage.Fresh from his victory in Florida, which ended the campaign of home-town candidate Marco Rubio, Trump moves a step closer to becoming the presumptive Republican candidate for President. But NBC rained on his parade by releasing the video he never wanted us to see. The compilation underscores the lack of integrity of the candidate.In the video, Trump is being asked about a powerful new ad against him, funded by the Our Principles PAC, in which women read out the toxic comments Trump has made against other women.Introducing the segment, host Matt Lauer takes a clip of Trump speaking on Good Morning America on Tuesday, and follows up with his statements on Today just a few minutes later, revealing how the candidate gives a totally different story in each interview. This is what happened: He talked to ABC first.   Here s what he said when asked about that ad,  Lauer states, rolling the footage.We see Trump on Good Morning America, stating that: Well, you know, I have seen it. And it was a Romney deal, Lauer then moves to the second clip, saying: Just a couple minutes later, he appeared live on this show. Here s what he had to say, In the next clip, filmed literally minutes after his previous statement, Trump has a completely different story. Honestly, I have not seen the ad. So I would have to see it. I have heard about the ad, but I have not seen the ad. So, just minutes apart, Trump has gone from saying that not only has he seen the video, but claiming to know that Mitt Romney is behind it   to revealing that he hasn t even seen the footage.So far the Trump campaign has made no formal response to the video, but it is highly embarrassing for the candidate who claims to be bringing a fresh, plain-speaking approach to politics. But of course, it s no surprise to anyone actually bothering to fact-check Donald Trump. After all, a recent study by Politico which analyzed more than 40 hours of footage from the Trump campaign found that candidate lies on average every five minutes. That might entertain some who are viewing this election campaign as if it were a reality show, but if Trump makes it to the White House, those voters will be join their fellow Americans in a reality most will find unbearable.

64559, Republicans Offered Condolences For Soviet Dictator Joseph Stalin When He Died,"Republicans need to stop whining about President Obama offering condolences for Fidel Castro s death, because they ve offered condolences for even worse monsters.After news of the longtime Cuban dictator s death, President Obama issued the following statement:At this time of Fidel Castro s passing, we extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people. We know that this moment fills Cubans   in Cuba and in the United States   with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation. History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him. Today, we offer condolences to Fidel Castro s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people. In the days ahead, they will recall the past and also look to the future. As they do, the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.President Obama s statement was much different from Donald Trump s, which seemed to celebrate Castro s death. Indeed, Trump s statement is the kind of dangerous reaction that could damage international relations between nations at a time when we should be seeking peace.Republicans, of course, have been attacking President Obama ever since. Marco Rubio called Obama s statement  pathetic.  Ted Cruz says the United States should not send anyone to represent America at the funeral.But once again, just like they did when President Obama did not attend former First Lady Nancy Reagan s funeral, Republicans are conveniently forgetting history and precedent.As it turns out, the Republicans themselves sent condolences after a brutal dictator died on two occasions. In 1953, President Eisenhower offered condolences upon learning that Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was near death.At this moment in history when multitudes of Russians are anxiously concerned because of the illness of the Soviet ruler2 the thoughts of America go out to all the people of the U.S.S.R. the men and women, the boys and girls in the villages, cities, farms and factories of their homeland.They are the children of the same God who is the Father of all peoples everywhere. And like all peoples, Russia s millions share our longing for a friendly and peaceful world.Regardless of the identity of government personalities, the prayer of us Americans continues to be that the Almighty will watch over the people of that vast country and bring them, in His wisdom, opportunity to live their lives in a world where all men and women and children dwell in peace and comradeship.That s right. Republicans sent condolences for a brutal dictator who murdered at least 10 million people and is known as one of the worst mass murderers of the 20th century.After Stalin died, Eisenhower even offered praise of Stalin and reached out to the Russian people in his  Chance for Peace  speech.The world knows that an era ended with the death of Joseph Stalin. The extraordinary 30-year span of his rule saw the Soviet Empire expand to reach from the Baltic Sea to the Sea of Japan, finally to dominate 800 million souls.The Soviet system shaped by Stalin and his predecessors was born of one World War. It survived with stubborn and often amazing courage a second World War. It has lived to threaten a third.Now a new leadership has assumed power in the Soviet Union. Its links to the past, however strong, cannot bind it completely. Its future is, in great part, its own to make.The United States was even represented at Stalin s funeral by U.S. Ambassador Jacob Beam.And when Mao Tse-tung died in September 1976, President Gerald Ford sent the following condolences: Mrs. Ford joins me in extending to you our deepest sympathy on the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung. Chairman Mao had a profound impact on his era. . . . Please accept my personal condolences. So by attacking President Obama, Republicans are being total hypocrites. Yes, Fidel Castro was a terrible person. But he was still a human being and many people are mourning him in Cuba. Sending condolences is the human thing to do and it s the American way even if the foreign leader who died was our enemy. By extending our hand in friendship, we are sending a message to the Cuban people letting them know that we are with them and that we still want to work with them to make a better world for both of our nations. It s how diplomacy works. Petty statements like Trump s only do more harm than good.Featured image via Cagle",1
60355, #NeverTrump GOPers Demand Emergency RNC Meeting In Last Ditch Effort To Unseat Trump,"The #NeverTrump GOP delegates are a determined bunch. They tried tirelessly to change the rules of the Republican National Convention to keep Donald Trump from officially becoming their standard-bearer. When the rule change was shot down, chaos ensued on the convention floor in Cleveland s Quicken Loans Arena as they demanded a roll call vote, which was also denied. This resulted in a walkout by the Colorado delegation, and, of course, the great Orange One was officially given the banner of the party to carry that Thursday night. Most people assumed that the  Free the Delegates  group was done after this. Nothing could be further from the truth, though.This same group of people is now calling for an emergency meeting of the Republican National Committee as they launch yet another sure-to-fail effort to dump Trump. It bears noting that this likely is mostly an effort to continue making noise, to show the RNC and the American public that the entire GOP is not like Donald Trump. The proposed purpose for the meeting is to lay out the law about how the RNC could go about defying the will of the Republican primary voters and get rid of Trump. They will be particularly interested in Rule 9, which is a provision specifically created to facilitate the replacing of an official nominee because of death, declination, or otherwise.  Since Trump isn t dead and likely won t be dropping out,  otherwise  is the vague word these Never Trumpers will be looking to find their loophole in.It probably won t happen, but seeing as how Trump is falling further and further behind Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the polls, they have reason to believe that he simply isn t a viable candidate. Further, the sea of controversy in which Trump has engaged since being formally nominated, from his ongoing feud with the family of a fallen Muslim American soldier to his initial refusal to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Senator John McCain, means that Trump clearly has zero capability or intention of becoming presidential. If all else fails, the #NeverTrump people could always support the new Independent bid by conservative intelligence official Evan McMullin.All of that being said, though, these folks may as well hang it up. The GOP is no longer the Party of Lincoln. It is the Party of Trump.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",1

24629,"Obama Celebrates Iran Deal As Senior Iranian Officials Say They Will NOT Uphold Their End Of Deal…Ayatollah: “Negotiation with America is Forbidden,”","Ever feel like a headline you re reading is too unbelievable to be true? I wish we could tell you that was the case. Read on Senior Iranian officials continue to lash out against the recent nuclear deal even as the Obama administration begins to implement it, according to a series of statements by the Islamic Republic s leaders.The aggressive rhetoric comes as the Obama administration celebrated on Sunday the implementation of the deal, hailing it as a  milestone  in U.S. diplomatic history. However, Iran has balked.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei took to his Twitter and Facebook pages to post an announcement titled,  Negotiation with America is Forbidden,  according to translations of the documents provided by the Middle East Media Research Institute.Other Iranian officials have demanded that the U.S. completely terminate economic sanctions, rather than suspend them, per the nuclear deal.Some Iranian leaders have stated that President Obama will announce this week the full termination of sanctions, a move that would likely spark anger on Capitol Hill.The White House said on Sunday that it would move forward with sanctions relief, even as Tehran insists it will not uphold its own end of the accord. Today marks an important milestone toward preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and ensuring its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful going forward,  Obama said in a statement issued by the White House. I have directed that the heads of all relevant executive departments and agencies of the United States begin preparations to implement the U.S. commitments in the JCPOA, in accordance with U.S. law, including providing relief from nuclear-related sanctions as detailed in the text of the JCPOA once the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has verified that Iran has completed all of its nuclear steps,  Obama said.Critics of the deal maintain that Iran s continued threats of violence against America and Israel could derail the agreement. Iran also has, in recent days, tested ballistic missiles, which is prohibited under United Nations resolutions and potentially a violation of the accord. For America negotiations with the Islamic Republic of Iran means penetration. This is their definition of negotiation and they want to open the way for imposition,  Khameniei declared on October 16, just two days before the deal went into effect.  Negotiation with America is forbidden, because of its countless detriments and because of alleged advantages of which it has none whatsoever. The institute, among others, has warned that these statements could mean that Iran will not honor the deal, even as the United States waives sanctions and releases more than $150 billion to Iran.It is unclear whether Iran will officially announce its adoption of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the institute said in an analysis of Khamenei s remarks.  It is also not clear whether the U.S. will announce its suspension of sanctions and the E.U. will announce its termination of sanctions, as per the agreement,  the institute said.Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, a senior Iranian cleric who is secretary general of Iran s Guardian Council, said that declarations by the U.S. administration do not mean Iran is ready to begin upholding the agreement. There are those who think that approval by the [Iranian Parliament] means approval of the execution of the agreement in Iran. This is not so,  Jannati said on Friday in Tehran.  Approval regarding the nuclear agreement is not [approval of] its execution. The nuclear agreement was discussed in the Supreme National Security Council and council members expressed their opinion about it and gave their approval regarding its execution,  he continued.  But Leader [Khamenei] still has not signed it. Iran continues to insist that sanctions be fully terminated and not reimposed in any manner going forward. The termination of the sanctions must be taken seriously. If they are terminated, it is a sign that the nuclear talks and agreement have yielded results,  Jannati said.  But if the other side breaks its promises and instead of terminating the sanctions [merely] freezes or suspends them, this shows that the nuclear agreement was useless. Nejatollah Ebrahimian, a spokesman for the Guardian Council, said on Saturday that the joint plan  remains a political document, not a legal one  because Iran has not officially approved it.Jannati and other leaders have expressed concern that the U.S. will try to force Iran to end its support to terror groups such as Hezbollah. If we do not stand fast against the other side, then the next day they will say that we must officially recognize Israel, give equal rights to men and women, cancel executions, sever relations with Hizbullah, and so on,  he said.Ali Larijani, the speaker of the Iranian parliament, also said in recent days that Iran has not approved the accord. We have not approved the [joint plan] in the way that the other side has said,  Larijani was quoted as saying by the institute.  We also have not said that it should be executed as is, but rather that the [plan] should be placed in the framework of the steps taken by the Supreme National Security Council. Ultimately, this council s approvals are sent for the approval of the Leader. Via: WFB",1

50812, WATCH: Trump ‘Honors’ Black History Month By Praising Himself And Attacking The Media,"It s the first day of Black History Month and Donald Trump was quick to celebrate it inappropriately.February is the month when our country recognizes the long history of African-Americans. Their achievements and struggles are America s achievements and struggles and we must recognize both to move forward and create a better future.But rather than honor Black History Month with the dignity it deserves, Donald Trump made it all about him instead.During a breakfast in the White House Cabinet Room, Trump said a few words about Black History Month.During this month we honor the tremendous history of the African-Americans throughout our country, throughout the world if you think about it, right? And this story is one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work, and faith in America. And then after giving a shout out to his token black cabinet member Ben Carson, who heads Housing and Urban Development despite having zero experience, he started bitching about and attacking the media over a report on Trump s first day that the Martin Luther King bust had been removed from the Oval Office, a mistake that was quickly corrected the same day but Trump still whines about. The statue is cherished, it s one of the favorite things, and we have some good ones, we have Lincoln and we have Jefferson, we have Dr. Martin Luther King,  he said.Trump then praised Fox News for kissing his ass and once again talked about inner cities as if they are crime-ridden war zones. I don t like watching fake news. Fox has treated me very nice, I don t know where Fox is, thank you. We need more jobs, better wages. We re going to work very hard in the inner city. Ben will be doing that, one of his big things. We need safer communities. We re going to do that with law enforcement. We re going to make it safe. We re going to make it much better than it is right now. Right now it s terrible. Not content to just use Black History Month as an excuse to air his petty grievances, Trump chose to pat himself on the back as well. If you remember, I wasn t going to do well with the African-American community. And after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things. We ended up getting   I won t go into details but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years. Hillary Clinton received 88 percent of the black vote on Election Day while Trump only received 8 percent, hardly something to brag about.Trump then gave permission to his black supporters to lavish him with praise.An Ohio pastor told Trump that  we love you  and actually dared to mention Trump and God in the same breath. He also somehow kept a straight face while claiming that Trump is a good listener.Trump then returned to bashing the media and whining. So much of the media is opposition party. Knowingly saying incorrect things. It s a very sad situation. But we seem to be doing well. You know, it s almost like, in the meantime we won. So maybe they don t have the influence they think. They really have to straighten out their act. They re very dishonest people. Here s the unbelievable video via YouTube.Basically, Trump said more about Omarosa and his black media surrogates than he did about black history, reducing the names of King, Rosa Parks, and Frederick Douglass to mere footnotes in his remarks and once again demonstrating that he is a disgrace.Featured image via screenshot",1

54411,"In Pennsylvania, Trump to propose childcare deduction tax break","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday will propose allowing families to deduct the cost of childcare expenses from income taxes, his campaign said, a move aimed at bolstering his support among women voters. Trump is to lay out the plan in an evening speech in the Philadelphia suburb of Aston, Pennsylvania, his latest attempt to construct a policy framework that he would use for governing if elected over Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8. Trump is to be introduced at the event by his daughter, Ivanka, who has championed the issue of childcare as an influential voice in his campaign. She told reporters on a conference call that she was involved in developing the plan. “I’m very passionate about this,” she said. Trump’s support among women voters has lagged. Overall, he has risen to a more competitive position against Clinton in national opinion polls and in battleground states where the election is likely to be decided. Polls show the race tightening in the crucial state of Pennsylvania. A Quinnipiac University poll last week said Clinton led 48 percent to 43 percent for Trump there, a reduction from her 10-point lead a month ago. Trump’s plan would change the U.S. tax code to let parents deduct from their income taxes childcare expenses for up to four children and elderly dependents, his campaign said. It would be available for individuals earning less than $250,000 a year or under $500,000 for couples filing jointly. Trump campaign officials did not detail the overall cost of the program. A senior official said it would be part of Trump’s plan to overhaul the tax code and would end up not adding to deficit spending in the U.S. budget. Trump would offer childcare spending rebates to lower-income taxpayers through the existing Earned Income Tax Credit. The campaign said this could mean tax rebates as high as $1,200 for eligible families each year. Trump also would create new Dependent Care Savings Accounts to allow families to set aside money “to foster their children’s development and offset elder care for their parents or adult dependents,” the campaign said. Individuals could contribute up to $2,000 a year tax free. The New York businessman also is proposing guaranteed six weeks of paid maternity leave. He would accomplish this by amending the existing unemployment insurance that companies are required to carry.  The benefit would apply only when employers do not offer paid maternity leave, and would be paid for by offsetting reductions in the federal unemployment insurance program so that taxes are not raised.

20727, Oregon Republican Wants To Put Right-Wing Militias On Government Payroll But Only To Defend Republicans,"After Friday s right-wing terror attack in Portland, in which two men were stabbed after coming to the aid of a Muslim teen, the nation seemed unsure of how to respond. One Republican responded, though. He says it s the GOP that s at risk and his solution is to hire the right-wing extremists as Republicans  personal bodyguards.It took Donald Trump three days, but his handlers finally released their official response to the attack, which was far too little too late, but still better than declaring himself the victim:The violent attacks in Portland on Friday are unacceptable. The victims were standing up to hate and intolerance. Our prayers are w/ them.  President Trump (@POTUS) May 29, 2017The irony is thick there, since Trump has been the leader of the hate and intolerance movement since at least 2011, when he became the leader of the birther movement, which tried to claim that President Obama was not born in the United States.Still, even after the attack, and after Trump s less than heartfelt response, James Buchal, the chair of the GOP Party for Multnomah County, which is home to Portland, said this to the Guardian: I am sort of evolving to the point where I think that it is appropriate for Republicans to continue to go out there,  he said.  And if they need to have a security force protecting them, that s an appropriate thing too. Asked if this meant Republicans making their own security arrangements rather than relying on city or state police, Buchal said:  Yeah. And there are these people arising, like the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters. Asked if he was considering such groups as security providers, Buchal said:  Yeah. We re thinking about that. Because there are now belligerent, unstable people who are convinced that Republicans are like Nazis. Both the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters are on the Southern Poverty Law Center s list of anti-government groups. In other words, they are terrorists.While it is true that constituents across the country are p*ssed at the fact that Republicans want to take away their healthcare, that hardly constitutes an existential threat, except perhaps to some careers.The fact is, though, that while the Oregon stabber supported Bernie Sanders, he only did so out of sheer hate for Hillary Clinton, and he s also a racist right-wing nut job and perhaps the only thing preventing him from being in one of those militias, was the fact that no one seemed to like him.Still, for some bizarre reason, snowflake Republicans think they are the ones under attack, so naturally, the only way to deal with that is to hire terrorists to protect them.",1
