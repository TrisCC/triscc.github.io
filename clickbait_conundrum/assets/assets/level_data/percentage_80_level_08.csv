7725,Protests at Donald Trump rally overshadow Washington primary win,"Donald Trump easily won the Washington state primary on Tuesday, but his victory was overshadowed by violence outside a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where protesters smashed windows and threw rocks at police.

With 73% of votes counted in Washington, Trump had won 76.2% of primary voters. John Kasich and Ted Cruz, both of whom have dropped out of the race, had won 9.9.% and 10.1% respectively.

Trump’s victory leaves him only needing a few dozen more delegates to reach the magic number of 1,237 required to cement the Republican nomination.



Outside Trump’s rally in Albuquerque, protests against the presumptive nominee turned nasty on Tuesday night, with protesters overturning crowd control barriers and throwing rocks at police.

There were early posts on social media reporting gunshots and tear gas, but the Albuquerque police department said those were inaccurate. Nonetheless, police horses were deployed to control the large crowd of protesters, and some reports showed pepper spray being used. The door to the convention center where Trump was speaking was also smashed.

More than an hour after Trump had finished speaking and left for California, where he will campaign for the next few days in the run-up to the state’s 7 June primary, hundreds of protesters still thronged the streets, waving Mexican flags, lighting fires and chanting.

Trump is the only remaining candidate campaigning for the Republican nomination, but Kasich and Cruz were also on the ballot in Washington, having suspended their campaigns after the ballots were printed.

Dr Ben Carson was also on the ballot because he reportedly never officially submitted a withdrawal of his candidacy to the state.



The state delegation, which was selected on Saturday at the state convention in preparation for the primary, is composed almost entirely of supporters of Cruz, whose supporters overwhelmed the state convention in Pasco.



Despite this, the delegates are bound by state party rules to vote for Trump on the first ballot at the national convention, US senate candidate and former chairman of the Washington state Republican party Chris Vance, who was at the convention, told the Guardian.

However, with seven upcoming primaries, including New Jersey and California, Trump is expected to easily overtake the delegate mark needed to win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention in Cleveland in July, avoiding a contested convention.

In a strange quirk of party politics, the Democrats also held a presidential primary in Washington on Tuesday, but it didn’t matter in the slightest because the Democratic delegation from Washington was already settled by a caucus in March, at which Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton 73% to 27%.

Interestingly, in the Democratic primary – which was admittedly meaningless as it has no bearing on the number of delegates as opposed to the caucuses – Clinton won comfortably, 53.63% to 46.37%, implying that perhaps Democratic voters want the primary season to be, finally, over with.",0

38921, Queen Declares RNC’s Use Of Their Music Was Unauthorized,"Yesterday, on the first day of the Republican National Convention (which turned out to be a complete disaster), Donald Trump introduced his plagiarizing wife, Melania, to the tune of Queen s 1977 hit rock ballad  We Are the Champions. The choice of song sparked outrage on social media (and rightfully so). Freddie Mercury, lead singer of Queen, was gay and, for a portion of his life, stricken with AIDS. This year s Republican platform is the most anti-LGBT in the party s history, and their vice presidential nominee, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, is a notorious homophobe who curtailed vital HIV/AIDS resources in Indiana.So the question was asked: given how hostile the GOP and Trump/Pence are to LGBT rights, why on God s green earth would Queen allow one of their most iconic hits to be played at the parade of hate?Well, it turns out, Queen never authorized the use of their song. In fact, the RNC actually went against their wishes:An unauthorised use at the Republican Convention against our wishes   Queen  Queen (@QueenWillRock) July 19, 2016Here s to hoping that the iconic band sues the hell out of the deficit stricken RNC. Although Queen is against their music being used, the right to use it doesn t come from them but rather the performing rights organization Broadcast Music Inc, which the iconic song belongs to for distribution.However, it remains to be seen if BMI authorized its use.Knowing the Trump campaign and the stupidity of the RNC, it may actually be highly unlikely that they did, and no one would be shocked if it slipped their minds.Countless celebrities and musicians alike have banned Republicans from using their music,  including Rage Against the Machine, Heart, Foo Fighters, the Rolling Stones, and Adele. Queen apparently was on th list, but Republicans chose to ignore their wishes. I wonder how long it will take them to blame Hillary Clinton for their mistake.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",1
49508,Malaysia in talks with U.S. firm Ocean Infinity to resume MH370 search,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is negotiating with U.S.-based seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to resume the search for Malaysia Airlines MH370, which vanished three years ago in the southern Indian Ocean with 239 people aboard.  The disappearance of the aircraft en route to Beijing from  Kuala Lumpur ranks among the world s greatest aviation mysteries after Australia, China and Malaysia ended a fruitless A$200-million ($157-million) search effort in January. This week, Malaysia said it had received proposals to continue the search from Ocean Infinity, Dutch firm Fugro and an unidentified Malaysian company. Ocean Infinity beat out the competition and the government has begun negotiations with it, Malaysia s deputy transport minister Aziz Kaprawi said on Thursday.    Yes, we are negotiating with Ocean Infinity, but the agreement has not been finalised,  he told Reuters, but declined to comment on the potential reward for the plane s discovery.   It was an offer on an open basis, that we will only honor if the aircraft is found.  The firm had made an offer on a  no-cure, no-fee  basis, according to a letter, seen by Reuters, that was sent to passengers  families on Thursday.  Australia and China were informed of the negotiation process, but only Australia had informally agreed to Malaysia s choice, Aziz said.    It is still under discussion with China,  he added, but declined to elaborate on China s possible concerns. Australian and Chinese authorities did not immediately respond to Reuters  requests for comment. Ocean Infinity could not confirm the award of a contract,  but good progress has been made , a spokesman said in a statement.     Calvin Shim, whose wife was one of the MH370 crew, said he was relieved authorities were considering resuming the search.   Grateful this step is finally being officially taken,  he told Reuters in a text message.          Relatives of others on board voiced concern over the lengthy talks, however. Families were told of Ocean Infinity s offer in March, said Grace Nathan, a lawyer whose mother was aboard.  The best weather for the search is spring and summer,  said Nathan.  We worry they will lose that window if they take too long to decide.    ",0
34180,Massive Spike In Obamacare Health Premiums Could Boost Trump To Victory,"Trump Says He Will Sign Very First Bill to Repeal Obamacare 
“This is ready-made advertising for Republican candidates to use nationwide,” stated Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. “If you’re a Republican candidate, it would be malpractice not to talk about it, highlight it or advertise on it.” 
To be sure, Trump has been hitting the issue hard over the past several days, mentioning the rate hikes at four separate rally appearances in a 24-hour period this week. 
“ Repealing Obamacare and stopping Hillary’s healthcare takeover is one of the single most important reasons that we must win on Nov. 8,” Trump told rally-goers Tuesday afternoon in Sanford, Florida. Advertisement - story continues below 
Other Republicans have been quick to jump on the issue as well, including vulnerable incumbent GOP senators like Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Roy Blunt of Missouri. 
Should these Republican senators and others maintain a focus on Obamacare during the final two weeks, they stand a good chance of fending off the Democrat effort to wrench control of the Senate away from the GOP. 
The same applies to Trump, should he refrain from media distractions and continue harping on the failures of Obama and his health care law, particularly in hard-hit swing states like Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, to name just a few. 
And he will have Obama to thank personally for paving the way to a Trump presidency through his horribly flawed Obamacare law. Advertisement - story continues below",1
37932, The Math Behind Why Trump Will NEVER Be President,"I m often told that Trump can beat Hillary, and therefore she shouldn t be the nominee. It s a good argument;  electability  and all that, but it s not true. Even slightly. In fact, never mind Hillary, we could nominate a potted plant on the left and Trump would STILL lose.How can I be so sure? Easy: Trump has to win 70% of the white male vote to become president.Good fucking luck with that.I know what you re thinking: Trump appeals directly to white resentment, how could he not have the angry white male vote totally locked up? Honestly, he probably does. This is something that, as a white male myself, I find incredibly annoying. That more than half of all white males would support such a piece of trash is embarrassing to say the least. But more than half is not the same as 70%.No one gets 70% of the white male vote. No. One.That s a larger percentage than Republicans have ever won before   more than the GOP won in the landslide victories of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and far more than they won during the racially polarized elections of Barack Obama.Of course, the argument often made by Trump s followers is that he will win in November because he will bring so many disengaged Americans to the polls. But they re talking about disengaged white voters, mostly mostly men   and unfortunately for him, the turnout rate for white men is already relatively high. Got that? Even when White America went completely insane at the idea of a black president, they STILL couldn t muster more than the 63% Reagan and Poppy Bush took in 1980 and 1988 or the 62% Dubya got in 2004. More importantly, as the country gets less lily white, even that 60%+ is losing its punch:By 2004, however, winning 62 percent of white men barely got George W. Bush past John Kerry in a squeaker. And eight years later, Romney won 62 percent of white men and lost to Barack Obama by 3.5 million votes.So what happened? Between Reagan and Romney, the white male share of the total vote had dropped from 45 percent to 35 percent.Ironically, the very thing Trump is harnessing to propel his campaign, white resentment at the waning of white supremacy, is what will ensure he can never win. It s such a thing a beauty that I want to redefine marriage again so I can walk it down the aisle.If you want a full breakdown of why Trump needs 70% of white men and how women, Latinos and black voters spell his doom, take a look at Politico s excellent analysis.Featured image via AI archives ",1
10326,"Pope holds emotional meeting with refugees, says ""Rohingya"" for first time","DHAKA (Reuters) - Pope Francis had an emotional meeting with Muslim refugees from Myanmar in Bangladesh on Friday and used the word Rohingya to describe them for the first time on his Asian trip, calling for them to be respected. He also urged the world not to ignore refugees, persecuted minorities, the poor and vulnerable. The encounter took place at an inter-religious peace meeting on his first full day in Bangladesh, to where 625,000 Rohingya from Myanmar s Rakhine state have fled from an army crackdown. Refugees have said scores of Rohingya villages have been burnt to the ground, people killed and women raped. Myanmar s military has denied accusations of  ethnic cleansing  by the United States and United Nations. The pope had earlier in the week visited Myanmar, where he met its leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. But there he avoided using the word Rohingya, a term the authorities reject. Many people in Myanmar regard the largely stateless Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. At the Bangladesh meeting, however, he said:  The presence of God today is also called Rohingya.  Addressing about 5,000 people at the gathering on the grounds of the Roman Catholic archbishop s residence, Francis said:  How much our world needs this heart to beat strongly, to counter the virus of political corruption, destructive religious ideologies, and the temptation to turn a blind eye to the needs of the poor, refugees, persecuted minorities, and those who are most vulnerable.  Aid workers brought 16 Rohingya refugees from camps in Cox s Bazar, about 430 km (260 miles) southeast of Dhaka on the border with Myanmar, to join other Muslims, as well as Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and charity workers. The pope looked somber as each member of the group, which included 12 men and four women, including two young girls, told him their stories through interpreters. Francis looked pained as he listened.  In the name of all those who persecute you, who have persecuted you, those who have hurt you, above all for the indifference of the world, I ask for forgiveness, forgiveness.  Francis said in improvised comments. Before that, in his calls for peace in Myanmar and Bangladesh, he had not publicly used the word Rohingya to describe the refugees   disappointing human rights groups and other prominent figures in the West who have condemned the repression. He had decided to follow the advice of Myanmar Church officials, who said his use of the word could prompt a backlash against Christians and hurt Myanmar s fragile path to democracy. One of the women refugees told Reuters before the meeting:  Myanmar military captured me and some other women, tortured us. I still bleed, there is pain in the abdomen, my back hurts, I get headaches. Medicines have not helped much.    I will share my pain with him,  the woman as her young daughter clutched at her burqa garment. The pope spoke under a huge tent-like canopy held up by  bamboo poles and covered with red, white and scarlet fabric to guard against the afternoon sun. He had first visited the cathedral and then was taken to the tent in a flower-bedecked peddle rickshaw that a man pushed up the central aisle. In his address, Francis said:  Religious concern for the welfare of our neighbor, streaming from an open heart, flows outward like a vast river, to quench the dry and parched wastelands of hatred, corruption, poverty and violence that so damage human lives, tear families apart, and disfigure the gift of creation,  he said. The pope has called for decisive measures to resolve the political reasons that caused the refugee crisis and urged countries to help the Bangladesh government deal with it. Earlier this year from the Vatican, the pope twice defended the Rohingya by name, once saying that they had been  tortured, killed simply because they wanted to live their culture and their Muslim faith . The Myanmar military launched the crackdown in response to Rohingya militant attacks on an army base and police posts in August and says it is a legitimate counter-insurgency operation. ",0
39264,Turkey's Erdogan defends Ottoman commander after UAE minister retweets criticism,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan leapt to the defence of an Ottoman military commander on Wednesday after the United Arab Emirates foreign minister retweeted accusations that Ottoman forces looted the holy city of Medina during World War One. Erdogan appeared to be responding to a tweet shared on Saturday by UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahayan, which said Ottoman troops led by Fakhreddin Pasha stole money and manuscripts from Medina in 1916. The tweet also said Turkish forces abducted residents of Medina and took them to Istanbul.  These are Erdogan s ancestors, and their history with Arab Muslims,  read the tweet,  originally posted by someone identifying themselves as an Iraqi dentist from Germany. Medina, now part of Saudi Arabia, was part of the Ottoman territory for centuries until the empire s collapse at the end of World War One. In a speech to local administrators, Erdogan said Fahreddin Pasha had not stolen from Medina or its people, but strived to protect the city and its occupants during a time of war.  Those miserable people who are delirious enough to shamelessly and tirelessly say Erdogan s ancestors stole sacred items from there and brought them to Istanbul - it was to protect them from the people that came to invade,  he said. The United Arab Emirates, a close U.S. ally, sees Erdogan s Islamist-rooted ruling party as a friend of Islamist forces which the UAE opposes across the Arab world. Relations were further strained by Ankara s support for Qatar after Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed sanctions on the Gulf emirate in June. Two months later, Sheikh Abdullah criticised what he called Turkey and Iran s  colonial  actions in Syria, even though Turkey and the UAE have both opposed Syria President Bashar al-Assad. Erdogan s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin has also responded to Sheikh Abdullah s comments, saying it was a shame that he  retweets this propaganda lie that seeks to turn Turks & Arabs against one another, again.   Is attacking President Erdo an at all costs the new fashion now?  Kalin tweeted on Tuesday. ",0
384, Watch Joe Scarborough Frantically Backtrack After Donald Trump Outs Him As A Supporter (VIDEO),"Considering left-leaning MSNBC still signs Joe Scarborough s paychecks and he s consistently feigned neutrality in the presidential election, it seemed clear that his support of Donald Trump was meant to remain under the radar. Unfortunately for that facade, nobody bothered to tell Trump.While Scarborough was interviewing Trump on MSNBC s Morning Joe things reached an awkward tipping point when the Republican front-runner casually remarked that he appreciated the fact that Scarborough and his co-host Mika Brzezinski were his  supporters  while most of the media was against him. It was great seeing you, you guys have been supporters and I appreciate it. And not necessarily supporters but at least believers. Hilariously, this sent the pundits scrambling to undo the potentially career-ending damage of being tainted with Trump s name. After all, it s bad enough that they, in their capacity as journalists, would choose to pull for any particular candidate, but a racist, xenophobic, torture-enthusiast one is egregious. Brzezinski fares pretty well. She has consistently criticized Trump s toxic demagoguery. Scarborough on the other hand In his clawing desperation to distance himself from Trump, he manages to throw several of his colleagues under the bus as well: Well, I will tell you what when you say  supported  you re talking about how actually   you re talking about Bob (Costa), Mika, myself, also Halperin, Willie and those of us around the table. There were a handful of people who for six months have been saying what happened last night could happen, and the rest of the media world has been mocking and ridiculing what he s done. But while Scarborough would like us to believe he s simply a political savant who predicted Trump s rise, there is mounting evidence that he really does long for a Trump win.In December, when Trump s campaign was starting to change from  This guy is a complete joke  to  This guy could actually win the nomination,  Scarborough openly bragged that he helped Trump prepare for the first debate. It was largely considered to be a make-or-break moment for Trump and his buddy Joe Scarborough was there to help walk him through the process. Let s allow Scarborough to tell it. I ve actually called him up, and I ve said  Donald, listen, you need to speak in complete sentences in debates.  And he goes,  I m up 30 points, Joe,  and I m like,  Good point, Donald,  he said to laughter.He later admitted he met personally with Trump to congratulate him on his second debate performance, albeit saying I hope we don t have reporters here. Further, there has been rumors that Scarborough and Brzezinski met up with Trump on the night of the New Hampshire primary to celebrate his first win. Again, he had hoped to keep it a secret. CNN broke the story anyway:Scarborough and Brzezinski visited Trump s hotel room on Tuesday night while the New Hampshire primary results were rolling in, according to two sources with knowledge of their visit. Scarborough and Brzezinski did not respond to a request for comment.After this article was published, Scarborough posted a series of tweets accusing CNN of lying about him.  Your sources are wrong,  he wrote. Scarborough did not explicitly deny that he visited Trump s hotel room, however.Undermining Scarborough s denials, Trump greeted Scarborough on Morning Joe by saying  it was great  seeing them the previous evening. Oops.While it s a wonder that anyone would support a guy like Trump, Scarborough s fixation isn t entirely out of left field. Despite his posturing as a  moderate  Republican, he s provided plenty of evidence to suggest a war-mongering, egomaniac like Trump would get him hot and bothered. When a group of U.S. soldiers accidentally floated into Iranian waters and were briefly detained, Scarborough shot off a series of embarrassing tweets that advocated for a president who was willing to start a world war over it.Hey Iran, you have exactly 300 days left to push a US president around. Enjoy it while you can. After that, there will be hell to pay.  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) January 12, 2016(Obama didn t take his advice. Instead, he got the sailors released in less than 24 hours by diplomacy. No shots were fired.)Scarborough has flirted with supporting Trump for too long. To maintain any credibility at all, he needs to either openly admit he s backing the racist buffoon or clarify why he feels so invested in helping him win the election. Hotel visits, late-night debate prep calls, endless soft interviews on his show, all of this is beginning to paint a pretty clear picture. It s not a good one.Featured image: Screenshot",1

16935,French Foreign Minister: Assad’s Denials of Chemical Attack ’100 per cent Lies’,"(AFP)  —   Syrian President Bashar  ’s comments that last week’s chemical weapons attack was a fabrication to justify a US military strike are “100 percent lies” French Foreign Minister   Ayrault said Friday. [“It’s 100 percent lies and propaganda,” Ayrault said during a visit to Beijing, responding to an exclusive AFP interview with Assad on Wednesday.  “It’s 100 percent cruelty and cynicism. ” The French minister mirrored language used by Assad himself, who dismissed the allegation that his regime perpetrated the attack that left 87 civilians dead, including many children. “Definitely, 100 percent for us, it’s fabrication,” Assad said in the interview. The Syrian leader questioned whether the attack had in fact occurred, claiming that “fake videos” and “propaganda” were being used against his government. He also accused the United States of colluding with terrorists and “fabricating the whole story in order to have a pretext” for a cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base last week. The French minister made the remarks during a joint press conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. “The reality is that more than 300, 000 have died, 11 million people have been displaced or become refugees, tens of thousands have been placed in Syrian prisons and a country has been destroyed,” Ayrault said. “That is the reality. It is not a fantasy. ” He emphasised the need for an end to the conflict with a “real ceasefire, one which restricts the Syrian air force and military and is upheld by the international community. ” Ayrault praised China’s role in the matter, noting its abstention from a United Nations Security Council vote on a resolution to condemn the Syrian gas attack. In the past, China has voted alongside Russia to veto UN resolutions on the Syrian conflict. Wang expressed his agreement with the French minister, noting that an “independent, fair and professional investigation” into the chemical weapons attack should be conducted “as soon as possible. ”",0

48540,A ‘Menagerie’ That Fulfills a London Dream - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   Without fanfare or flourish, the   Cherry Jones has calmly established her place as one of the major stage actresses in the United States. She has won two Tony Awards, received an Emmy for her role as President Allison Taylor in “24,” and earned rave reviews both on and off Broadway. But she had appeared in just one production in Britain  —   at last year’s Edinburgh International Festival, in John Tiffany’s production of Tennessee Williams’s “The Glass Menagerie. ” As Amanda Wingfield  —   a desperate single mother trying to hold on to her alienated son, Tom, and find a viable life for her disabled and shy daughter, Laura  —   Ms. Jones triumphed both in the production’s original run on Broadway in 2013 and in Edinburgh. She was “an Amanda that may someday be spoken of with the awe that surrounds Laurette Taylor’s creation of the part nearly 70 years ago,” the critic Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times after the Broadway opening. Now Mr. Tiffany (who directed the hugely successful “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” in London last year) has brought that production to the Duke of York’s Theater in London’s West End, where it opened this week. (Michael Esper and Kate O’Flynn will play Tom and Laura, with Brian J. Smith as the Gentleman Caller.) There, Ms. Jones, 60, has finally made her London debut, some 40 years after she created a folder and named it “My Career on the British Stage. ” In a Skype call from Paris, Tenn. where she grew up, Ms. Jones talked about her early desire to act, her initial resistance to the role of Amanda and her growing love for the character. Here is an edited and condensed version of the conversation: Is there any reason that you’ve never performed in the West End? No, not really. It’s strange, because I have always wanted to work in England, I didn’t care where. My mother was a teacher of English and American literature, and she lived and breathed all things British. I first went there when I was 14. My parents had saved up and we went for the most wonderful two weeks, traveling all over. Afterward, I made a folder titled “My Career on the British stage. ” So you knew very early that you wanted to act? I never wanted to do anything else. I was always creating wonderful adventures with my neighborhood friends, assigning roles to people. My family was very supportive. And it all went pretty smoothly. I never had tremendous ambition, I was just thrilled to be in a repertory company, and when I came to New York and could work Off Broadway, or get little movie roles, I would feel so fortunate. Given your Southern background, Amanda Wingfield seems like a natural role for you. But you have said in interviews that you never wanted to play her. Why? I think I had a Southern chip on my shoulder. I felt she didn’t speak to me, I didn’t know who this woman was. I auditioned for the role of Laura several times, but I was too large. Then John Tiffany and I met through a mutual friend, at the time that my sister and I were clearing our family home here in Paris, Tennessee. I was telling John about the letters from my mother that I had found, and he said: “We’re going to work together and you are going to be my Amanda. ” Once you began to study the part, how did you feel? The moment I spoke her words in a reading, I knew who she was. I had grown up with her not quite with women in her situation, but women in dire straits. I am the last generation who really remembers those Southern women they had an elegance and nobility, and a real charm and style. When I was about 10, they were in their 70s and 80s, and I was mesmerized by the way they moved and spoke. For a long time I thought “war” was spelled “wawa” because of the way they said it. And the way they smelled, a lovely light powdered smell and the slight mustiness of mothballs, and hot chocolate and cheese biscuits. It was heaven. The language too, is so spot on. Every idiom, the musicality of it, is perfect. So perhaps your resistance to playing Amanda came from that closeness? Yes, perhaps I felt protective of those women, that the play was too exposing. When I did the first reading  —   with Michael Esper, who then came to the show for Edinburgh and now again in the West End  —   he made me understand the play and the family in a way I hadn’t before. I saw the possibilities in what he did with his role the love and gentleness he had. This isn’t a family that hate each other. They love each other, and we wouldn’t care, otherwise. Then John Tiffany seemed to understand the tone of each scene so beautifully. I didn’t realize what a loving, fearless woman Amanda is. She has to push her children, cajole, charm. I have never felt a woman more determined. Perhaps Tennessee Williams was creating the fighter that he would have liked his mother to be. This will be your third run in this production. Has your interpretation changed since the first Broadway season? I think it’s just the longer you do the part, the richer the memories get. What I mean is that I have her memories I can see those carriage rides in the country, those afternoons with the gentlemen callers. And I do believe there were 17 of them, and half of them were gay! No one had any money, they had a bit of  ’s silver and bought her some cotillion dresses, and the gay boys and straight boys would come over and they would drink sherry and have a rollicking good time. Philip Roth, the novelist, said that when writing, he can get to a point when he is not creating, he is just remembering his character’s memories. It’s like that.",0
55321,Trump says he 'brilliantly' used U.S. tax laws,"PUEBLO, Colo. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Monday he “brilliantly used” U.S. tax rules to his advantage in trying to limit the amount he paid in taxes, arguing it helped him survive a difficult period in the real estate market. “I was able to use the tax laws of this country and my business acumen to dig out of the real estate mess ... when few others were able to do what I did,” Trump told a crowd in Pueblo, Colorado. It was Trump’s first extended comments since a New York Times report said he had claimed a $916 million loss on his 1995 tax returns, which experts said might have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for 18 years.  Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has seized on the report, arguing the tax records undercut Trump’s business acumen.  “What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year? This is Trump to a T, he’s taken corporate excess and made a business out of it,” Clinton told a rally in Toledo, Ohio, on Monday. Clinton has repeatedly called on Trump to release his full returns, as presidential candidates have done in the past.  Trump was dismissive of the Times’ story in his Pueblo remarks, saying the media was “obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the 1990s.” The Trump campaign has not said, however, that the Times’ story was inaccurate. Instead, his supporters, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie have contended that Trump’s aggressive use of provisions under U.S. law to minimize his tax liability was evidence of his “genius” as a businessman and real estate investor. Trump picked up on that theme on Monday. “I have brilliantly used those laws,” he told the crowd in Pueblo. The flap over Trump’s taxes comes during what has been a difficult stretch for the candidate, who faced criticism for his performance in the Sept. 26 debate against Clinton and his subsequent public spat with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. A Reuters/Ipsos online poll last week showed a majority of Americans felt Clinton won the debate, the first of three scheduled between the candidates.. On Monday, the state of New York ordered Trump’s charity, the Trump Foundation, to suspend raising money amid a probe into its activities. ",0

He noted Trump’s unwavering support of the Jewish state, citing as evidence of this the appointment of David Friedman  —   who was in attendance at the event  —   as U. S. ambassador to Israel as well as Nikki Haley’s appointment as U. S. ambassador to the United Nations. Trump first made the embassy transfer pledge during his election campaign, heralding a break from decades of U. S. policy. Trump is slated to visit Israel at the end of May, coinciding with Jerusalem Day, which will mark the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem in the 1967 defensive war. As Breitbart Jerusalem reported last month, the visit also comes ahead of the June 1 expiration of a congressional mandate to move the U. S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which has been extended each year since 1995. A State Department spokesman declined to comment on whether Trump would renew the waiver come June. Trump refused to comment directly on whether he would use the visit to announce an embassy move, telling Reuters in a recent interview: “Ask me in a month on that. ” In his remarks on Tuesday, Pence called the founding of the Jewish state in 1948 “nothing short of a miracle. ” “The people of Israel have turned hope into a future of security and prosperity,” he said. Pence added that “under President Donald Trump, let me assure you this, if the world knows nothing else, the world will know this  —   America stands with Israel. Her cause is our cause. Her values are our values. Her fight is our fight. ”",0
34405,The Guide to Being an Airbnb Superhost - The New York Times,"IN my spare time, when not writing about consumer technology for The New York Times, I have a sideline renting out a cabin on Airbnb. So when Jose reserved the property last October, it was nothing unusual. He said he wanted to host some relatives for a quiet weekend in the mountains. I welcomed him without hesitation. That Saturday, my neighbors texted me as they watched caterers carry large white pillars and bouquets into the backyard. Then 10 cars surrounded the front yard and dozens of people wearing suits and dresses poured into the house. It became clear this was no intimate  . For a day, my Airbnb rental was turned into a wedding venue, which broke city laws. My business would be in jeopardy if the police were notified. Such is life as an Airbnb “Superhost. ” Since buying my cabin in Northern California in late 2015, I have hosted about 30 groups and become part of the booming ecosystem for Airbnb, the online reservation marketplace that lets people turn their homes into vacation rentals. With more than 140 million guest arrivals to date, Airbnb has proved a boon for hosts and an attractive option for travelers looking to avoid hefty fees from hotels. In the process, I have been named a Superhost, which means I have hosted many guests and consistently received   reviews. It’s a small group  —   researchers say only about 7 percent of hosts are Superhosts. In exchange, I get more visibility in search results, invitations from the company to exclusive events and a medal next to my profile photo. The designation as a Superhost has paid off: My house is a few bookings away from netting a profit. Yet vaulting to Superhost status is hardly intuitive, and I learned hard lessons along the way. Here are some tips on running a successful (and lucrative) Airbnb rental based on interviews with Superhosts and my experience. People who rent your house on Airbnb are choosing it over a hotel. So you had better be as hospitable, friendly and communicative as a hotel. For your rental, that means a few things. Provide staples like cooking equipment, cable TV, soap for bathing and cleaning, towels, toothpaste and toilet paper. Your house should work as advertised  —   faulty appliances should be repaired or replaced. For another, be extremely responsive to guests, much like a hotel front desk. Nobody trusts a host who is slow to respond. Jasper Ribbers, a   of “Get Paid for Your Pad,” a book about his experience as an Airbnb Superhost who has completed more than 300 stays, uses the app AvivaIQ to respond automatically to messages from potential guests, which comes in handy when he is asleep. When he is awake, he can continue the conversation. Being dishonest about your listing will hurt when it comes time for a guest to leave a review. It’s better to be straightforward about what you are offering and transparent about any imperfections. In my experience, guests were surprised in the summer that the house lacked   even though the listing never said it had  . I resolved this with subsequent guests by saying explicitly in my welcome email that the house lacked   and that portable fans were in each room. Be quick to address complaints, or risk facing a negative review. If a dishwasher breaks or the shower pressure is too low, send a plumber. If a remote control was misplaced or stolen by a previous group, have a backup remote ready in a drawer. If you host the property remotely, the best option is to befriend someone trustworthy in the neighborhood who can act as a property manager. Pay the manager a fee for each task. Airbnb attracts travelers from all over the world, and it is remarkable how standards for cleanliness differ from person to person. My jaw dropped when one guest left a positive review about her stay, but dropped me one star because the   brush was dirty. (Couldn’t she have used the clean sponge instead?) There is no point acting defensive. The solution is to hire superb professional cleaners. Relay any negative feedback from guests to your cleaners so they improve over time. Depending on where your house is, demand may be higher at certain times of year. If you hope to ever make a profit, you will want to set prices higher during peak rental seasons, and reduce prices during slow seasons. But constantly changing prices on your listing can be daunting. I use a dynamic pricing tool, BeyondPricing. com, that automatically adjusts prices based on demand, including factors like holidays, peak travel season and the day of the week. (Airbnb provides its own dynamic pricing tool called Smart Pricing, but in my experience it chooses rates that are too low.) Last year, Airbnb introduced an   policy that urged hosts to welcome guests regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender and age. That makes sense, since Airbnb wants to connect hosts with travelers from all over the world. But it doesn’t mean you should let just anybody into your home. Hosts reserve the right to decide what types of groups they would like to host, especially when taking into consideration city laws. For my rental, city law forbids loud parties past 10 p. m. When guests request the house, I ask them the purpose of the visit and ask them to carefully read and agree to my house rules, including one about loud noise. I am less inclined to book a group of college students looking to have a party than I am to book a family planning a winter vacation. (Though if the students promised to stay quiet, I would probably book them.) Mr. Ribbers, the Airbnb Superhost, said he preferred families or couples staying in his   apartment in Amsterdam partly because of the size constraints. He also typically accepts bookings only from guests who already have positive reviews themselves. When guests reserve his home, he reads their profiles to get a sense of their personalities and check if they have verified their identities with Airbnb by providing driver’s license information, among other documentation. Some vetting is permitted by Airbnb’s nondiscrimination policy, which says hosts can decline to rent based on factors that are not prohibited by law  —   so my rejection of those planning to have loud parties fits the bill. Another important point is to describe your listing depending on the guests you want. Mr. Ribbers titled his listing “Couples Getaway. ” My listing, intended to attract family ski trips, advertises the house’s proximity to the ski lifts. Most guests are not bad people. But perhaps one out of 10 times, a rotten egg will pass your smell test. The lesson I learned from Jose was that being a Superhost did not make me impervious to the actions of a misbehaving guest. To protect yourself, diligently document everything valuable in your house. Take photos of countertops, the refrigerator, stove, dining table, barbecue grill and television set. In the event anything is damaged, Airbnb will ask for    photos to prove that guests caused the damage. With Jose, after an Airbnb representative evicted the group for breaking my house rules, I found a large chip in my kitchen countertop. After sending Airbnb the photo of the damaged countertop, a company representative concluded it was not reasonable to let me keep Jose’s security deposit because “there is no way to document whether or not the chip on the counter was there before or after this guest stayed at the listing. ” Airbnb did agree to charge Jose for excess guests  —   but only for those my neighbors were able to photograph. Nick Shapiro, an Airbnb spokesman, said I should have been treated better and the company apologized that its resolution process “did not work as it was supposed to in this incident. ” In my conversations with Jose, he insisted that he did nothing wrong and that I broke the contract by kicking his group out of the house. Neither of us could leave each other a review because his reservation was voided.",0
37621,Overwhelmed by ‘Brexit’? Here Are the Basics - The New York Times,"Here is a guide to understanding Britain’’s vote to leave the European Union, a decision known as “Brexit” that will have global consequences for years to come. Complete news coverage is here. More than 17. 4 million Britons voted June 23 to sever ties with the European Union, whose seat of power lies in Brussels, compared with 16. 1 million who voted to remain. The stunning vote, 52 percent to 48 percent, plunged world financial markets into turmoil, the political consequences for the prime minister of Britain were swift, and people around the globe reacted with shock and confusion. It would be the first time any country has left the bloc. Fear of being overrun by immigrants was a driving concern for “Leave” voters, who appeared to dominate the conversation on social media. Globalization concerns and a desire to wrest Britain from under Brussels’ thumb were also factors. The referendum came about as a result of a promise made in 2013 by Prime Minister David Cameron to appease an increasingly vocal   Union wing of his Conservative Party. ■ The prime minister said he would step down. Mr. Cameron, who led the “Remain” campaign, announced on Friday that he had no ”precise timetable” but that he believed his successor  —   who will manage the process of leaving the union  —   should be in place by October. Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who backed leaving the E. U. was considered a   to succeed Mr. Cameron. But on June 30, Mr. Johnson announced he would not run for the position of party leader (and therefore prime minister). ■ Global markets plunged. The British pound plummeted to its lowest level since 1985. Investors fled to the American dollar and the yen.  ■ The U. S. market was down more than 3 percent at the close on June 24, with the Dow shedding over 600 points, after   overnight in Japan and Hong Kong. The financial damage was more severe on the Continent than in Britain and the United States.  ■ The United Kingdom lost its last remaining AAA credit rating on June 27, when the credit rating agency Standard  Poor’s downgraded the nation to AA, Reuters reported. ■ The referendum is not legally binding, though it is difficult to imagine that the British government would ignore the will of the voters. The process of leaving begins only after the British government invokes a provision of the European Union’s governing treaty known as Article 50  —   an action Mr. Cameron said he would leave to his successor. Once Article 50 is invoked, though, Britain could not change its mind and stay in the union unless the 27 other members all agreed. ■ Britain would leave the world’s largest common market, with 508 million residents, including 65 million Britons. That would free them from the bloc’s commitment to the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services. But it would also bring complications, with some businesses already planning to relocate. ■ Little will change for at least two years, but the vote sets off a series of negotiations as the country separates from the union’s remaining 27 members. Britain, which has the bloc’s   economy after Germany, would have to come up with new trading agreements. Almost half its exports are sold on Europe’s common market. ■ London’s role as a financial center could be imperiled, particularly if the trade in   securities moves to rival cities like Paris and Frankfurt. ■ The immediate effect on travel will be limited, especially as Britain was not a member of the   Schengen zone, which came under heavy pressure last year from the refugee crisis. Americans will find bargains in travel to Britain, because of more favorable exchange rates. ■  Britain’s security will be largely unaffected: It remains a nuclear power, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a leader of NATO. ■ Scotland and Northern Ireland could go their own way. Both voted overwhelmingly to stay in the E. U. But prominent political leaders in Scotland and Northern Ireland called on Friday for new moves toward separating from Britain. Scotland, which voted in 2014 to remain in the United Kingdom, may revisit that referendum. Northern Ireland has an open border with the Republic of Ireland, a member of the bloc. Border crossings could now be tightened, and pressure could increase for unification, prompting instability in both places. ■ Calls for similar action have spread throughout Europe. “We must now have the same referendum,” French   National Front party leader Marine Le Pen tweeted. Politicians made similar appeals in Denmark and the Netherlands. In Italy, one politician called for a referendum on whether to keep the euro currency. ■ President Obama said in a statement: “The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision. ” He pledged that the U. K. and the E. U. would remain “indispensable partners of the United States” and that Britain’s “special relationship” with the United States would endure. ■ Hillary Clinton: “We respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made. Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America. ” ■ Donald J. Trump: “I said this was going to happen, and I think that it’s a great thing. ” The British people “have declared their independence from the European Union, and have voted to reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy,” Mr. Trump said. “A Trump administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain. ” ■ Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany expressed disappointment with the vote and called for European unity. “Our goal should be to create a future relationship between Great Britain and the European Union that is close and  . ” ■ Moscow maintained its stance that the British referendum was of little direct concern. President Vladimir V. Putin said, “This will certainly have consequences for Britain, for Europe and for us. The consequences will be global, they are inevitable they will be both positive and negative. ”",0
4479,Sean Spicer: No Evidence of Connection Between Trump Campaign and Russia - Breitbart,"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer ripped into the media on Friday for continuing to ask questions about a connection between the Trump campaign and Russia, noting that there’s been no evidence of that. [“Everyone who’s been briefed on this subject, from Republican to Democrat to CIA  —   former Obama administration’s [Director of National Intelligence James] Clapper, [CIA Director John] Brennan, you name it  —   all of the people come back with the same conclusion  …    that there’s been no evidence,” he said at the White House press briefing.  Spicer said if anyone was trying to engage with Russia, it was Hillary Clinton. “It was Hillary Clinton, who was the architect of the last administration’s failed reset policy  —   she told Russian state TV that it was designed to strengthen Russia. That was their goal: to strengthen Russia,” he said. “She used her office to make concession after concession, selling off   of our country’s uranium, paid speeches, paid deals, getting personal calls from Vladimir Putin. I think if there’s  —   really want to talk about a Russian connection and the substance, that’s where we should be looking,” he added. Spicer was referring to how in 2010,   of State Clinton was one of nine to sign off on Russia’s purchase of a controlling stake in Uranium One, an international mining company headquartered in Canada. Around the same time, a Russian investment bank paid Bill Clinton $500, 000 to give a speech. “When you talk about connections to Russia, the only connection that anyone’s made with President Trump is multiple years ago he hosted a pageant there and he’s  —   some of the  —   you know, he owns condos around the world and some of them were sold to some Russians and I think he sold a house to one several years back. That’s his connection,” he said. “So when you compare the two sides in terms of who’s actually engaging with Russia, trying to strengthen them, trying to act with them, trying to interact with them, it is night and day between our actions and her actions,” he said. “And yet no one questioned what she was doing or how she was handling it. ” Critics of President Trump have argued that his campaign aides colluded with Russia to help him get elected. While intelligence officials have assessed that Russia tried to interfere in the U. S. elections in favor of Trump by hacking into the Democratic National Committee and Clinton aide John Podesta and leaking embarrassing emails, there has been no evidence that Russia affected the outcome of the election or that there was collusion with Trump campaign officials. The FBI is investigating the matter, and the House and Senate intelligence committees are also investigating it. But Clapper told NBC News on March 5 that no evidence existed that showed any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “Not to my knowledge,” he said, when asked if any evidence existed. Clapper said there could have been information found since he left the government on January 20, but as of then, “We had no evidence of such collusion. ”",0
43233,AT&ampT Agrees to Buy Time Warner for $85.4 Billion - The New York Times,"In the world of media, bigger remains better. So in the wake of Comcast’s $30 billion takeover of NBCUniversal and Verizon Communications’ serial acquisitions of the Huffington Post and Yahoo, ATT has bought one of the remaining crown jewels of the entertainment industry. The telecommunications giant agreed on Saturday to buy Time Warner, the home of HBO and CNN, for about $85. 4 billion, creating a new colossus capable of both producing content and distributing it to millions with wireless phones, broadband subscriptions and satellite TV connections. The proposed deal is likely to spur yet more consolidation among media companies, which have already looked to partners to get bigger. This year, Lionsgate struck a deal to buy the   channel Starz for $4. 4 billion. And the Redstone family, which controls both CBS and Viacom, has urged the corporate siblings, which split 10 years ago, to consider reuniting. ATT and Time Warner said both of their boards unanimously approved the deal. “When Jeff and I started talking, it became clear to us very quickly that we shared a very similar vision,” Randall L. Stephenson, ATT’s chief executive, told reporters on a conference call on Saturday, referring to Jeffrey Bewkes, Time Warner’s chief executive. “Time Warner, we believe, is the clear leader in premium content. ” Most analysts and investors have noted that Time Warner was part of one of the biggest merger follies of all time, when it sold itself to AOL at the height of the   boom. That combination  —   also pitched on the idea of uniting content and the internet  —   proved unwieldy and was later stripped apart to a few core businesses. This time, however, the rise of online outlets like Netflix, Amazon Prime and YouTube and the shift of younger customers from traditional media have pressured media companies to seek out consolidation partners. These media companies are anticipating drops in fees from cable service providers and declining revenue from advertisers. Getting bigger would give them more negotiating leverage with both service providers and with advertisers. Among their top priorities is finding new ways of reaching consumers. HBO, for example, offers its HBO Now service to deliver shows like “Game of Thrones” and “Westworld” to consumers who do not have cable subscriptions. Even Disney, widely seen as the strongest content company, with brands like Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, has been grappling with how to overcome challenges facing its network channels. ESPN, which long served as a growth engine, is now facing declining ratings and subscriber erosion, putting advertising sales into question. “The biggest thing that we’re trying to do now is figure out what technology’s role is in distributing the great content that we have,” Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, said at a presentation at Boston College on Oct. 5. Comcast’s takeover of NBC has proved a model for this new world of media  . While the cable giant has occasionally been scrutinized for possible regulatory violations, NBCUniversal has generally thrived under its current ownership, with NBC enjoying a ratings comeback and Universal delivering a wide range of hit films, from blockbusters like “Jurassic World” to dramas like “Straight Outta Compton. ” Still, Time Warner’s deal with ATT is likely to face tough scrutiny from government regulators increasingly skeptical of power being consolidated among a few titans. Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, indicated on Saturday that he would seek to block the merger if elected “because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few. ” Over the last decade, Time Warner has spent significant time selling or spinning off AOL, many of the Time Inc. stable of publications, and Time Warner Cable, which was sold to another cable operator. The remaining businesses are HBO, one of the     channels Warner Bros. movie studios and cable channels that include CNN, TNT, Turner Sports and TBS. Overseeing much of Time Warner’s downsizing was Mr. Bewkes, for whom Saturday’s agreement serves as validation of sorts. He faced tough questions two years ago when he turned down 21st Century Fox’s bid of $85 a share, arguing that the offer sharply undervalued his company. Now, Mr. Bewkes has found a suitor willing to offer significantly more  —   $107. 50 a share in cash and stock  —   and done so at a time when media companies are under pressure to strike their own deals. ATT’s offer represents a roughly 35 percent premium to where Time Warner’s stock was trading before news reports of the merger talks emerged. “Time Warner chairman and C. E. O. Jeff Bewkes and his senior management team can see where the entire legacy media world is headed: secular decline,” Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, wrote in a research note on Saturday. Mr. Greenfield added, “We believe Bewkes will end up being remembered as the smartest C. E. O. in sector  —   knowing when to sell and not overstaying his welcome to maximize value for shareholders. ” The announcement on Saturday also affirms the ambitious   of ATT. One of the former   Baby Bells that arose from the 1982 breakup of the original ATT, the company has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on acquisitions to reconstitute some of its parent’s empire. That has included buying DirecTV for $48. 5 billion, adding satellite TV subscriptions as an additional source of negotiating leverage with content providers, along with the satellite company’s steady stream of cash. ATT has also made other moves to acquire content. It has set up a joint venture with Peter Chernin, a prominent media executive, and the company was one of the bidders for Yahoo this year. The telecom company has also been working on its own online video service, for which Time Warner’s trove of media could prove enormously helpful. Combining with ATT is meant to accelerate those efforts, Mr. Bewkes said. “We think this is great for continued innovation in content,” he said during Saturday’s conference call. Still, ATT’s biggest rivals have not stood still. Comcast struck an agreement this spring to buy DreamWorks Animation for $3. 8 billion, adding the “Shrek” and “Kung Fu Panda” franchises to its media holdings. Verizon has charted a different course, focusing more on   properties and advertising technology players rather than traditional media companies. Its $4. 8 billion deal to buy Yahoo, rooted in the aging tech company’s hundreds of millions of users, follows previous takeovers of the Huffington Post and AOL. Not everyone seems persuaded by the latest flurry of  . Disney commented on the deal in a statement late Saturday, saying, “A transaction of this magnitude obviously warrants very close regulatory scrutiny. ” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, also put out a statement cautioning approval. “I will be looking closely at what this merger means for consumers and their pocketbooks, and whether it stands up to stands up to the rigorous review standards set by the Department of Justice’s antitrust division in the last few years,” he said. And in a Twitter post on Saturday, Steve Case, the former chief executive of AOL responsible for the doomed merger with Time Warner, wrote of ATT’s move, “#DejaVu. ”",0
