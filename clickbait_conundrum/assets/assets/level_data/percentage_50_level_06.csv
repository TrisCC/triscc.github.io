44431,France paying close attention to U.N. report on chemical attacks in Syria,"PARIS (Reuters) - France said on Thursday it was paying close attention to evidence from a U.N. investigation that shows Syrian forces used chemical weapons in different attacks in 2017 and before. French President Emmanuel Macron said in May, barely two weeks after his inauguration, that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would represent a red line and result in reprisals.     U.N. war crimes investigators said on Wednesday that Syrian forces have used chemical weapons more than two dozen times during the country s six-year civil war, including a deadly attack that led to U.S. air strikes on government planes. Syrian government forces carried out chemical attacks seven times between March 1 and July 7, according to the U.N. investigation, suggesting attacks would have taken place after Macron s warnings.   We are paying extremely close attention to the consistent evidence revealed by the commission regarding different types of chemical attacks on 2017,  a foreign ministry spokeswoman said in response to a question on what Paris would do if its red line had been crossed.   She said the foreign ministry called for those behind the April 4 sarin attack on Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province, which killed more than 80 civilians, to be held to account. ",0
55525,Did you know that cinnamon can boost intelligence?,"Did you know that cinnamon can boost intelligence? 
Saturday, October 29, 2016 by: Amy Goodrich Tags: cinnamon , intelligence , Parkinsons disease (NaturalNews) Cinnamon is one of the world's most consumed spices. For thousands of years, it has been prized for its medicinal properties and sweet, warming taste. Aside from sprinkling cinnamon on top of your lattes or adding magic to grandma's apple pie, researchers have found that consuming this tasty household spice also might enhance learning skills.Scientists at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago found that increased ingestion of cinnamon significantly improved the memory of ""poor learning"" mice. Recently, their findings were published in the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology in an article entitled ""Cinnamon Converts Poor Learning Mice to Good Learners: Implications for Memory Improvement.""The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Alzheimer's Association. How cinnamon affects the brain For the study, lead researcher Kalipada Pahan, a neurology professor at Rush University Medical Center, and his team zoomed in on two key proteins, GABRA5 and CREB, located in the hippocampus region of the brain. The hippocampus is a small part of the brain that generates, organizes, and stores memory. Previous research has shown that lower levels of CREB and higher levels of GABRA5 occur in the brain of poor learners.To see if ground cinnamon could improve the memory of slow learners, the researchers took a group of mice and placed them in a maze with 20 holes. The experiment was focused on watching the mice learn how to locate their target hole.When they tested the mice again after one month of cinnamon feeding, the researchers found that the mice determined to be poor learners had significantly improved their memory and learning skills. They could find their target hole twice as fast.Pahan and his team explained that when cinnamon is ingested the body converts it into sodium benzoate, a chemical compound used to treat brain damage. Furthermore, they discovered that when benzoate entered the mice's brains, it increased CREB, decreased GABRA5, and stimulated hippocampal neurons, which led to improved memory and learning skills.""We have successfully used cinnamon to reverse biochemical, cellular and anatomical changes that occur in the brains of mice with poor learning,"" Pahan said.However, no significant improvements were seen in the mice that were considered good learners. But Pahan added that if these results could be replicated in slow learning students, cinnamon could become one of the safest and easiest approaches to convert weaker students to good learners. Cinnamon may halt the progression of Parkinson's disease Pahan and his colleagues previously found that cinnamon had a positive effect on the brains of mice with Parkinson's disease. When cinnamon transforms into sodium benzoate, it works to protect the neurons, normalize brain cells, and improve communication within the brain, which slows down the progression of the disease.Given their promising results, Pahan and his team - supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health – plan on moving forward with testing in human patients with Parkinson's disease.""This could potentially be one of the safest approaches to halt disease progression in Parkinson's patients,"" Pahan said. ""It would be a remarkable advance in the treatment of this devastating neurodegenerative disease,"" he added.Before starting to add cinnamon to all your dishes, know that not all cinnamon is created equal. Pahan explained that there are two major types of cinnamon available in the United States - Chinese or cassia cinnamon and Ceylon cinnamon. While both metabolize into sodium benzoate, Ceylon cinnamon is much better than Chinese cinnamon. Chinese cinnamon contains coumarin, a molecule that can damage the liver . Sources:",1
47675,Exclusive: U.S. envoys told to be coy on re-engaging in Paris climate deal - cable,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. diplomats should sidestep questions from foreign governments on what it would take for the Trump administration to re-engage in the global Paris climate agreement, according to a diplomatic cable seen by Reuters. The cable, sent by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to embassies on Friday, also said diplomats should make clear the United States wants to help other countries use fossil fuels. In the wake of President Donald Trump’s announcement in June that the United States would withdraw from the accord, the cable tells diplomats to expect foreign government representatives to ask questions like: “Does the United States have a climate change policy?” and “Is the administration advocating the use of fossil fuels over renewable energy?” If asked, for example, “What is the process for consideration of re-engagement in the Paris Agreement?”, the answer should be vague: “We are considering a number of factors. I do not have any information to share on the nature or timing of the process,” the cable advises.  A U.S. State Department official declined to comment on the cable. (Click here for a link to the cable: here ) Trump, a Republican, had campaigned on a promise to “cancel” the Paris deal, saying he believed it would cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars while leaving developing nations such as China unfettered. In a sharp difference with the previous administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, Trump has several times called climate change a hoax. In June, Trump left the door open to re-engagement if terms improved. The United States will “start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair,” he said. The State Department guidance clarifies that right now, “there are no plans to seek to re-negotiate or amend the text of the Paris Agreement.” But it adds: “The President is sincere in his commitment to look for a path to re-engage that takes into account his concerns for U.S. economic growth and energy security.”    The Paris accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, seeks to limit planetary warming by curbing global emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists believe drive global warming. The United States, under the Obama administration, had promised to cut emissions as much as 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.  Separate from the diplomatic cable, the Trump administration is reviewing a draft report written by scientists across 13 federal government agencies that shows the effects of climate change pose dire, near-term threats to the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment on the draft, which The New York Times published on Monday. The report puts the White House in the awkward position of either clearing the report’s findings or editing them.  The diplomatic guidance makes clear that the United States intends to attend global climate summits during the prolonged process of withdrawing from the Paris deal to protect U.S. interests. The next summit is in November.  A U.S. official said a major priority in these talks would be to beat back attempts to have separate standards in the guidance on emissions cuts for rich and poor nations - long a sticking point in negotiations. “There’s certainly nothing in the policies of this administration that would make us think that we should be acting differently,” the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal memo.  The cable also anticipates questions over why the United States has changed its policy to make it easier for global development banks such as the World Bank to finance coal-fired power projects. In 2013 the Obama administration said the United States would oppose most coal projects, guidance since altered by the Trump administration.  “The new principles will allow the (United States) the flexibility to approve, as appropriate, a broad range of power projects, including the generation of power using clean and efficient fossil fuels and renewable energy,” the cable said.

38317,WHOOPI GOLDBERG RANTS: ‘Stupidest Thing’ That UCLA Players Did: ‘You embarrassed the president’ [Video],"Well this is a shocker! The usual leftist slant on The View was put aside for some support for President Trump. Who knew these political hacks could be reasonable and kind to Trump! Whoopi Goldberg took the lead when she gave the three basketball players who were detained by China a tongue lashing Yes, what were they thinking? She surprised everyone when she brought up how they embarrassed the president. No kidding! Whoopi Goldberg and her co-hosts on ABC s  The View  expressed their astonishment Thursday at the fact that three UCLA freshmen basketball players were accused of shoplifting while on a team trip to China.The players were arrested by Chinese police and only released this week after President Donald Trump asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to intercede. Goldberg said the players embarrassed Trump and the country, but credited the president for helping the players return to the U.S. You embarrassed your families, you embarrassed the country, and you embarrassed the president,  Goldberg said.  Now I m not a big fan of the president, but the fact that he had to call and get your asses out of there is not anything to be proud of or think is cool.

69905,"OBAMA’S BACKDOOR GUN CONFISCATION: 260,000 VETERANS STRIPPED Of Second Amendment Rights","Obama s cowardly backdoor gun confiscation starts with those who ve risked their lives defending our rights.In what amounts to a backdoor gun grab, two Senate Republicans are demanding to know why the VA stripped 260,000 veterans of their Second Amendment rights.As of December, the VA has reported 260,381 individuals to the FBI as  mentally defective  and therefore not permitted to purchase a gun, Guns.com is reporting.U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa lawmaker who is currently the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman, finds this unacceptable. Our military heroes risked their lives to protect and defend this country and all that we stand for, including our most basic constitutional rights,  said Grassley in a statement.  Now the very agency created to serve them is jeopardizing their Second Amendment rights through an erroneous reading of gun regulations. The VA s careless approach to our veterans  constitutional rights is disgraceful. In an effort to fix the issue, Grassley, along with Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee Chairman Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., penned a letter to VA Secretary Robert McDonald last week and another to the subcommittee over the agency s funding, questioning the practice.Making a due process argument, the lawmakers argue the VA uses the fiduciary trustee status of a veteran to regulate firearms possession without ever seeking to find out if the service member is a danger to themselves or others. The use of the VA regulation, adopted for a totally unrelated purpose, is suspect, especially in light of the Supreme Court holding that the Second Amendment is a fundamental right,  reads the letter to McDonald.  That holding changed the legal calculus by which a regulatory scheme can survive constitutional scrutiny and it is not clear how these regulations would fare under that increased scrutiny.

9987,Trump says picks Mulvaney to be White House budget director,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he has chosen U.S. Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina to be his White House budget director, turning to a fiscal conservative to help pursue his policy agenda. The nomination to be director of the White House Office of Budget and Management will require Senate confirmation. The announcement was made as Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, began his holiday vacation at Mar-a-Lago, his oceanfront club in nearby Palm Beach, Florida. Mulvaney, 49, was an outspoken critic of former House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, who resigned in 2015 amid opposition from fellow Republicans who were members of the House Freedom Caucus. Mulvaney’s selection points to a strategy by Trump to cut government where he can. The president-elect in recent days has, for example, railed against what he has labeled a far too expensive new version of the Air Force One aircraft he will fly that Boeing is supposed to build. In a statement announcing his selection, Trump called Mulvaney a strong voice in Congress for “reining in out-of-control spending, fighting government waste and enacting tax policies that will allow working Americans to thrive.” “With Mick at the head of OMB, my administration is going to make smart choices about America’s budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayer’s trust in how their money is spent,” Trump said. Mulvaney said the Trump administration “will restore budgetary and fiscal sanity back in Washington”. “Each day, families across our nation make disciplined choices about how to spend their hard-earned money, and the federal government should exercise the same discretion that hard-working Americans do every day,” Mulvaney said. Trump on Friday night vowed to seek approval from Congress to spend $1 trillion in new spending to rebuild America’s crumbling network of roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure as a way to create jobs and make some needed repairs. “We are going to fix our country. It’s time. We have no choice. It’s time,” Trump said in Orlando, Florida. Democratic President Barack Obama had sought infrastructure spending but was thwarted by Republicans in Congress. ",0

248, Video Shows Whales Swimming That May Change Everything We Know About The BP Oil Spill (VIDEO),"We know that the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill was one of the worst manmade disasters in history. Scientists are still desperately studying the behavior of marine life in the region hoping to find clues as to better understand just how much harm BP caused the ecosystem in 2010.That s why when a video showing a pod of orcas swimming very close to the mouth of the Mississippi River off the coast of Louisiana, scientists started paying attention. Whales have never before been seen swimming in the area. While orcas do enjoy coastal waters, they prefer to stay in colder waters.The video was captured by a fishing group, who sent the footage to local news station WWLTV. Dr, Moby Solangi, who is the President and Executive Director of The Institute for Marine Mammal Studies, told WWLTV: This is really an amazing story that you have told. We have not heard about this before.  Dr. Solangi then on went to say that,  That is concerning, you know. It s when these animals start showing signs of change, we need to pay attention. In the video, which is embedded below, it is mentioned that there was another recent example of large marine life exhibiting bizarre behavior. Just two months ago, a group of young pygmy whales was found beached in Mississippi, hundreds of miles away from their normal habitat.When asked about what role the BP spill may have had in these incidents, Dr. Solangi responded, saying: That certainly disrupted their habitat. There s no question. These are top predators and if they re moving somewhere, something may be going on. What s even more disturbing about this is the revelation that BP is facing very few consequences for the marine armageddon they unleashed. In April, it was reported that BP will have to pay $20 billion dollars in a settlement for the disaster.  Though, since we currently live in an age where corporations can get away with just about anything, BP is able to deduct more than $15 billion dollars of the settlement expenses in tax breaks.Scientists are hard at work trying to figure out what exactly is going on in the Gulf region. This bizarre whale migration may just be the thing that points scientists in the right direction.You can watch the video below.Featured image from video screenshot Featured image from video screenshot",1
27586,The “Blacks For Trump” Man Once Belonged To A Murderous Cult,"Comments 
Republican nominee Donald Trump has been strategically placing certain people behind his him at rallies to create a false illusion about the diversity of his supporters. You may have noticed a man holding a “BLACKS FOR TRUMP” sign behind the racist rabble-rouser at his events, with a website URL “GODS2.com” underneath it. If you’ve wondered just what kind of black Americans could bring themselves to support Trump or if this election could get any weirder, well, hold on to your seat. 
The man holding the sign is “Michael the Black Man,” also known as Maurice Woodside or Michael Symonette. LittleGreenFootballs did some research and discovered that Michael isn’t your ordinary concerned citizen. He’s a former member of a murderous cult , Yahweh ben Yahweh, led by preacher Hulon Mitchell Jr. 
Michael, along with 15 other Yahweh followers, was charged for allegedly conspiring in two murders; his brother, who was also in the cult, told jurors that Michael had helped beat one man who was later killed and stuck a sharpened stick into another man’s eyeball. But jurors found Michael (and six other Yahweh followers) innocent. They sent Mitchell away for 20 years in the federal pen. 
Michael later reinvented himself as a radio host and an anti-gay, anti-Obama preacher and soon found himself in the spotlight at Republican events, whose organizers were delighted to have found another person of color to attack Obama without being obviously racist. His website, GODS2.com, is filled with the delusional, vaguely anti-Semitic rantings of a madman and homages to Yahweh. 
This may not mean much in the long run, but it’s worth pointing out just how outrageous the hypocrisy of the Trump campaign is. Trump attacked Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton when the father of the Orlando nightclub shooter appeared in the stands behind her at a rally out of chance, accusing her of associating with the father of a deranged murderer – but this man is actually being planted behind Trump because of his skin color.

10161,War on cash goes into full effect – Citibank stops accepting cash at multiple branches,"War on cash goes into full effect – Citibank stops accepting cash at multiple branches Governments loathe cash transactions because they’re private and hard to tax By Jack Burns - Thursday, November 17, 2016 1:36 PM EST 
In 2015, as a guest on Ron Paul’s Liberty Report, Economics Professor Joseph Salerno warned of a coming war on cash. Apparently, now, that time has come. Governments loathe cash transactions because they’re private and hard to tax. As a result, some countries are taking drastic measures to reclaim their bank notes. Salerno said, “The French premier last year (2014) drew a parallel between the war on terror and the war on cash,” and warned the world’s economic elite are now “using the war on terror as a cover to get at cash.” The Mises Institute professor and VP predicted to Paul, “I think this could come in the next couple of years. If they have to bail out the financial system again…they’ll block the cash in the banks to prevent it from escaping and destabilizing these fractional reserve banks,” Salerno said. 
At the time of the interview, 2015, Salerno said the war on cash has already begun in the U.S. and pointed to Citibank’s new policy which disallows patrons to use cash to pay their mortgages and credit cards with cash. He also pointed to Louisiana’s new law forcing “second hand dealers defined as Goodwill Stores, Flea Markets, Garage Sales, to report any cash transactions in which they were receiving or paying cash, and they had to report them on a daily basis to the local police authorities.” He said, “they (secondhand stores) had to get the sellers’ names and license plate number and a number of other of private details.” 
“This is only a first step,” even though it was only on a state level. “It would be awful if it was on a federal level,” Salerno declared. 
While it hasn’t happened yet on a federal level in the United States, cash reclamation is occurring today in India. But before we get to what’s taking place in India, we must first examine the reasons frequently given by government to resort to controlling the public’s access to cash. Salerno stated the government offers phony reasons why it must control cash. It’s to prohibit terrorists, tax evaders, money launderers, and profiteering by drug cartels. If one hears the government making such claims, get ready, a cash grab is about to happen. 
Salerno pointed to Greece’s implementing a “cash point charge” for withdrawing Euros from their bank accounts, allowing government to charge citizens for withdrawing their own funds. He says mainstream economists have been promoting the war on cash for some time in order to prop up fledgling banks. 
“I assure you other governments are watching this experiment (in Greece),” he said. Salerno also stated the real war on cash seeks to “force the public to make payments to the financial system” in order to “enable governments to expand their ability to spy on and keep track of their citizens’ most private financial dealings in order to milk their citizens out of every last dollar of tax payments that they claim are due.” He stated another reason to destabilize cash is to “prop up the unstable fractional reserve banking system which is in a state of collapse all over the world.” 
Keep in mind, Salerno made his comments a year ago. 
Fast forward to 2016, and the world is now witnessing the first major bank to announce it will no longer accept cash deposits or deal in cash. Citibank Australia’s head of retail bank Janine Copelin offered an explanation saying, “We have seen a steady decline in the demand for cash services in our branches — in fact, less than 4% of Citi customers have used this service in the last 12 months.” The company stated it will no longer handle currency as a result. 
“This move to cashless branches reflects Citi’s commitment to digital banking and we are investing in the channels our customers prefer to use…While the number of customers visiting our branches to access cash handling services has fallen, the branch network remains an important component of how we serve our high-net-worth customers,” said Copelin. 
Maybe no one’s eyebrows are raising after Citibank made its declaration because some advanced societies have quite naturally moved away from hard cash transactions, preferring the ease of pay by phone, debit cards, or credit card purchases. After all, someone in the United States could very easily live without cash. Many do already. 
According to the Guardian , Sweden leads the world when it comes to not using cash. “Cards are now the main form of payment: according to Visa, Swedes use them more than three times as often as the average European, making an average of 207 payments per card in 2015.” But in some parts of the world, cash is still king. 
Just this week, India made a major move to control its citizens’ access to their cash by banning the 500 and 1000 rupee notes. According to the LA Times , “An exasperating cash crunch has gripped India in the week since Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the unprecedented step of withdrawing the country’s large currency notes from circulation. Modi surprised the nation by announcing an instant ban on the 500-rupee and 1,000-rupee notes, worth about $7.50 and $15, respectively, and which account for 86% of the cash in the market.” 
And just as Salerno predicted governments would do, the Indian government claimed the move was meant to serve as a ”sweeping move against corruption that would force Indians who hold large amounts of undeclared wealth to deposit the money at banks and make their assets official.” In other words, just as Salerno declared, rich Indians, whose private business dealings were done in cash, will now be forced to deposit their banned bank notes — or risk losing all of their wealth. 
The value of the currency, if deposited, will then be able to be tracked by the Indian government, a move Salerno stated would lead to higher taxes on its wealthy citizens, and greater returns for the banking system. And the Indian government has already admitted that’s precisely what they’re trying to do. 
Also, as Paul and Salerno predicted, the move has had devastating effects on the poor, many of whom have now reverted to bartering for their needs, according to the Times. The financial decision “stunned hundreds of millions of poor and working-class Indians who live an almost entirely cash-based existence, paying in bills for everything from rent to groceries to cellphone credit.” And they never saw it coming. 
“The plan was shrouded in such secrecy that even India’s financial institutions were ill prepared, creating long, sometimes unruly lines outside banks, ATMs and chronically understaffed post offices that are authorized to exchange the now-worthless notes and dispense new ones,” writes the Times. 
Exacerbating the financial crisis is the fact the government issued a smaller-sized currency which no longer works with current ATMs, forcing many customers not to be able to make any purchases at all, and thereby creating a loss of revenue for businesses hit hard by fewer customers, and chaos for everyone else. The best way to describe the upheaval in India is by imagining all Americans attempting to pay all of their purchases with one dollar bills. 
In India, according to the Times, two-thirds of all transactions are done in cash, an economy the government has labeled “black money.” Modi’s administration aims to tax that money. “Much of the wealth that India has accumulated since economic reforms began in the 1990s has never been taxed or accounted for, parked instead in real estate, gold, foreign investments and, in some cases, bundles of cash sitting at home. It is those stacks of bills that Modi, who took office 2½ years ago on promises to curb corruption, aimed to bring into the open. Supporters of the prime minister’s plan said those holding cash stockpiles would have to deposit them at banks, where huge amounts would draw the scrutiny of tax authorities, or allow their value to evaporate.” 
Sounding, as some would say, like Donald Trump, Modi said over the weekend, “I promise you I will give you the India of your dreams.” But right now, India is living a nightmare. 
India’s decision to reclaim its currency has some questioning whether the United States would attempt to follow suit and reclaim its own currency. 
For free thinkers everywhere, it may be time to take those 100 dollar bills and swap them out for one dollar denominations, or even begin to purchase gold and silver as many preppers have done already. If the proverbial shit hits the fan, taking notice of what’s happening in the world may prove to be a wise decision. With Australia’s Citibank declaration it will no longer deal in cash, with Sweden’s cashless society as a model of the future, and with India’s reclamation of bank notes, it’s anyone’s guess what the American economic crisis may look like. But it probably won’t involve cash.",1
29084,New Prospects for Growing Human Replacement Organs in Animals - The New York Times,"For the first time, biologists have succeeded in growing human stem cells in pig embryos, shifting from science fiction to the realm of the possible the idea of developing human organs in animals for later transplant. The approach involves generating stem cells from a patient’s skin, growing the desired new organ in a large animal like a pig, and then harvesting it for transplant into the patient’s body. Since the organ would be made of a patient’s own cells, there would be little risk of immune rejection. The    pigs would be examples of chimeras, animals composed of two different genomes. They would be generated by implanting human stem cells into an early pig embryo, resulting in an animal composed of mixed pig and human cells. One team of biologists, led by Jun Wu and Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte at the Salk Institute, has shown for the first time that human stem cells can contribute to forming the tissues of a pig, despite the 90 million years of evolution between the two species. Another group, headed by Tomoyuki Yamaguchi and Hideyuki Sato of the University of Tokyo, and Hiromitsu Nakauchi of Stanford, has reversed diabetes in mice by inserting pancreas glands composed of mouse cells that were grown in a rat. The Salk team’s report is published in Thursday’s issue of Cell and the   team’s in Wednesday’s issue of Nature. The two reports together establish the feasibility of trying to grow replacement human organs in animals, though such a goal is still far off. “I think this is very promising work in principle,” said Rudolf Jaenisch, a stem cell expert at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass. Many technical and ethical barriers have yet to be overcome, but the research is advancing alongside the acute need for organs some 76, 000 people in the United States alone are awaiting transplants. Creating chimeras, especially those with human cells, may prove controversial, given the possibility that test animals could be humanized in undesirable ways. One would be if human cells should be incorporated into a pig’s brain, endowing it with human qualities. Almost no one wants a talking pig. Another untoward outcome would be if human cells should come to compose the pig’s reproductive tissues. Few people want to see what might result from the union between a pig with human sperm and a sow with human eggs. In 2005, Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas introduced a bill imposing a $1 million fine on anyone creating and profiting from a chimera with human cells in its brain or reproductive tissues. That bill went nowhere, but in deference to public concerns the National Institutes of Health in 2015 instituted a moratorium on using public funds to insert human cells into animal embryos. The N. I. H. proposed last August to lift the ban, but to require grant proposals involving the insertion of human stem cells into early animal embryos to be examined by an expert committee. The public comment period on the proposal drew 22, 000 responses that it reviewed. . The ban is still in place, and it’s unclear whether the Trump administration would continue to consider lifting the moratorium or whether new objections would be raised to using public funds for this line of research. “We have no indication one way or another that they have any opinions on this,” said Carrie D. Wolinetz, the associate director for science policy at the N. I. H. Insertion of human stem cells into the early embryos of monkeys was prohibited in 2009, and remains so because monkeys, given their evolutionary closeness to humans, might easily have their brains altered by human cells. Biologists’ interest in chimeras has been prompted by the limited success in coaxing medically useful tissues from stem cells grown in glassware.   human stem cells were first derived from human embryos in 1998 and from ordinary adult tissue cells in 2007. After each discovery there were hopes of converting the cells into therapeutic tissues by exposing them in glassware to the sequence of natural chemicals that in the living embryo directs them into constructing the heart, brain, lungs and other organs. But no one knows exactly what sequence of chemicals is required for the generation of each different tissue or organ. This may be why glassware experiments with stem cells have not yet lived up to their full promise. Some biologists believe a better approach may be to grow stem cells not in glassware but in a developing embryo, where they will be exposed to the natural sequence of chemicals required to induce each type of organ. “In the last 18 years, hundreds of labs, including ours, have tried to generate different cell types from human pluripotent stem cells in the culture dish with a cocktail of factors,” Dr. Izpisua Belmonte said. “But the cocktails are not identical to what the cells experience in the embryo. So I thought, ‘Why not let nature do the job? ’” Dr. Izpisua Belmonte’s and Dr. Nakauchi’s teams have both pursued a strategy of directing the human donor cells to generate specific organs in the recipient species. This is desirable for both technical and ethical reasons. Dr. Nakauchi has disabled the master gene in rats for making a pancreas so that when mouse stem cells are injected into the early embryo of such a rat, the growing embryo has no choice but to construct its pancreas of pure mouse cells, instead of the usual mixture of rat and mouse cells. Generating inviting homes for the donor cells may reduce the risk that they will be incorporated in nontarget tissues like the brain or reproductive tissues. Also, an organ made purely of donor cells can be transplanted into the donor animal with minimal fear of rejection. In practice, about 10 percent of the mouse pancreases generated in rats was composed of rat cells, because the rat supplies the blood vessels for the organ. But the rat blood vessels seem to be quickly replaced when the organs are transferred to mice. The mice with their new pancreases lived in good health for a year after the transplant. They came from the same inbred strain as the donor mice, so they did not reject their new organs. The result provides proof of principle that Type 1 diabetes can be treated by growing a pancreas from an individual’s cells in another animal, Dr. Nakauchi and colleagues conclude. The next step is to repeat the experiment in pigs, which produce organs of a more suitable size for use in humans. Dr. Izpisua Belmonte’s team has now shown that human stem cells do survive in pig embryos and help form their organs, although not very efficiently. “The human cell doesn’t contribute much. To the brain we observed little or no contribution at all,” said his colleague Dr. Wu. “This is good news because we can guide the human cells to the organ we want. ” Both Dr. Izpisua Belmonte and Dr. Nakauchi said there was a long way to go before human organs could successfully be grown in animals like pigs. Chimeras will be more immediately useful in studying human embryogenesis, testing drugs and following the progress of disease. To achieve the goal of growing human organs for transplant, researchers must first engineer pigs that cannot make the organ of interest. In mice, this has already been done for the pancreas, heart and eye. They must then show that human stem cells can construct such an organ in a pig. Since the pig will supply the blood vessels and nerves, these will need to be replaced by the recipient’s cells after transplant without triggering immune rejection. If rejection does occur, the researchers will have to knock out the pig’s vasculature genes and arrange for these too to be humanized. Complex organs, like the heart, will be harder to grow than those like the pancreas which has a single kind of progenitor cell. All these steps, though they seem feasible, will require several years to develop and test. Both scientists expressed confidence that ethical concerns about chimera research could be addressed. Chimeras are typically mosaics in which each organ is a mixture of the host and donor cells. But new techniques like the   gene editing system should allow the human cells in a pig embryo both to be channeled into organs of interest and to be excluded from tissues of concern like the brain and reproductive tissues. “This isn’t dangerous research. We’re not creating monsters,” Dr. Nakauchi said. “There isn’t a need to get into a debate about moral humanization if scientists target the organs where the human cells will go,” said Insoo Hyun, a medical ethicist at Case Western Reserve University. “Scientists are not making chimeras just for fun  —   it’s to relieve the dire shortage of transplantable organs. ” Concern about human cells’ incorporation into a lower animal’s brain is not without basis. Dr. Steven Goldman of the University of Rochester Medical Center found in 2013 that mice injected with a special type of human brain cell had enhanced learning abilities. But other forms of humanized mice, such as mice engineered to have a human immune system, are routine laboratory animals that seem to occasion little angst. Dr. Izpisua Belmonte’s insertion of human stem cells into pig embryos was not affected by the N. I. H. moratorium on such chimeras because he used private funds. His experiment was approved by the authorities in Spain and in California, and following their advice, the development of the pig chimeras was stopped after four weeks in the womb. Dr. Nakauchi moved his lab to Stanford from Tokyo in 2014 because Japanese regulations do not allow chimera research, only to be hit with the N. I. H. moratorium a year later, which prevented him from making chimeras with human cells. His mouse pancreas experiment has taken eight or nine years to complete. “I have been in a very frustrating situation,” he said.",0
50288,Mexico’s Finance Minister Resigns Amid Fallout From Trump Visit - The New York Times,"MEXICO CITY  —   One of President Enrique Peña Nieto’s top ministers and closest allies resigned on Wednesday, an apparent casualty of Mr. Peña Nieto’s wildly unpopular meeting last week with Donald J. Trump. The spectacle of the Mexican president standing next to the Republican candidate who has disparaged Mexicans prompted widespread dismay and anger here, and reportedly divided Mr. Peña Nieto’s cabinet. Luis Videgaray, the finance minister who stepped down on Wednesday, had championed the idea of inviting Mr. Trump to Mexico City over the objections of other ministers, according to several Mexican news media reports, though Mr. Peña Nieto insisted it was his own initiative. Mr. Peña Nieto announced Mr. Videgaray’s resignation at a news conference. He did not give a reason for Mr. Videgaray’s departure. But some analysts interpreted it as the latest, and most dramatic, effort by the president to regain the trust of the Mexican public following his meeting with Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, who has made criticism of Mexicans and Mexico an incendiary motif of his campaign. “It will help mitigate the anger,” said José Antonio Crespo Mendoza, a professor of politics at Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas, a Mexican research and higher education center. “President Peña Nieto realized things could not stay as they were, and that they could no longer insist that it had been a good call” to invite Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump cast his visit as a statesmanlike effort to reach out to a country he had alienated. But hours after his meeting with Mr. Peña Nieto, he gave a combative speech in Phoenix that struck many of the   themes that have defined his candidacy. The episode has left Mr. Peña Nieto and his government embarrassed at a time when his approval ratings were already at record lows over rising crime, poor economic growth and conflict of interest scandals. In the days after the meeting, the president scrambled to contain the fallout and to repair the damage  —   using a television interview, a newspaper column and a    meeting held to mark his annual “Informe de Gobierno,” Mexico’s equivalent of the State of the Union address. But these steps seemed to do little to mollify many Mexicans, who accused the president of humiliating the nation, first by inviting Mr. Trump and then by failing to use the opportunity to push back against the candidate’s criticism of Mexico and Mexicans. The discontent has continued to simmer on social media and in the news, and an   Nieto demonstration has been called for Sept. 15. On Tuesday, an opposition senator  —   seeking to provide the defense of Mexico that he said Mr. Peña Nieto had failed to offer  —   submitted a bill that would empower the government to fight several of Mr. Trump’s foreign policy proposals, including his promise to force Mexico to pay for the construction of a border wall and his threat to withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement. “Of all the scandals Peña Nieto has faced, this is the most devastating,” said Alfonso Zárate, a political analyst and columnist in Mexico City. From Mr. Trump’s perspective, the trip was a risky move from the start, given the potential for embarrassment if the Mexican president were to criticize him publicly. It came together after Jared Kushner, the    and campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, began to lay the groundwork with Mexican officials in early August. Mr. Kushner dealt with Mr. Videgaray and other government officials in negotiating how the meeting would happen, according to a close ally of Mr. Trump who was involved in the arrangements. Mr. Trump’s visit was largely   and provided his campaign with pleasing visuals of the Republican nominee standing side by side with a head of state. But any positive effect was undone by Mr. Peña Nieto’s insistence afterward that he had told Mr. Trump that Mexico would not pay for a border wall, a claim that contradicted Mr. Trump’s account. Even so, the damage to Mr. Peña Nieto seems to have been far worse. While Mr. Videgaray’s resignation may have been intended to stanch the political bleeding in Mexico City and salvage the president’s standing, it also shifted the odds in the contest for future leadership of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P. R. I. In addition, it left Mr. Peña Nieto without one of his closest confidantes in his administration. Mr. Videgaray, who holds a doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had been a rising star in the P. R. I. and his name was often mentioned as a possible presidential contender in 2018. He had worked for the president since 2005, when Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor of the State of Mexico, helping him restructure the state’s debt and coordinating Mr. Peña Nieto’s 2012 presidential bid. Mr. Videgaray became the president’s closest ally and adviser in the cabinet  —   “the power behind the throne,” Mr. Zárate said. His reputation was tarnished by reports he had bought a house at a golf club from a government contractor, though not enough to force him out of the cabinet or out of contention for 2018. The president, who is known for his loyalty to his inner circle, stuck by him. Indeed, Mr. Peña Nieto was accompanied by Mr. Videgaray when he made the announcement on Wednesday, and was warm and effusive toward his longtime adviser, thanking him for being “committed to Mexico and loyal to the president of Mexico. ” Mr. Zárate said the departure of Mr. Videgaray was “very painful for the president. ” He added, “we all know the enormous influence that he has. ’’ “It leaves the president orphaned,” Mr. Zárate said. As finance minister, Mr. Videgaray was at the center of the administration’s efforts to overhaul the country’s telecommunications and energy sectors. He successfully pushed to open the nation’s oil industry, which had been a   monopoly since the 1930s. He also championed a tax overhaul that increased tax revenue but earned him some enemies within the business community. During his tenure, however, Mexico saw slow economic growth and a weak peso, and the country’s standing with   agencies has suffered. Moody’s Investors Service and SP Global Ratings have each lowered their outlook from stable to negative in recent months. Economic performance has been so underwhelming that some analysts believe Mr. Videgaray’s departure was an inevitability discussed well before Mr. Trump’s visit. Furthermore, Mr. Videgaray is rumored to be a possible P. R. I. candidate for the governorship of the State of Mexico. “I see this as a clear electoral play,” said Genaro Lozano, a professor of United States government and society at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City. “The State of Mexico is what they are betting on, what they have their eye on. It is one of the largest states in terms of population, with a solid and powerful P. R. I. structure, electoral support base and political mobilization. Even if they would put Trump’s cousin as candidate for governor, P. R. I. would win. ” The cabinet shuffle occurred a day before the Mexican government was scheduled to present its 2017 budget, a job that now shifts to the new finance minister, José Antonio Meade, whose appointment was announced at the news conference. Mr. Meade, 47, who has a doctorate in economics from Yale University, has been a significant player in the last two administrations. He was finance minister under Mr. Peña Nieto’s predecessor, Felipe Calderón, and Mr. Peña Nieto made him the foreign minister in 2012. In that post, he broke from his reputation as an apolitical technocrat when he led an angry defense of the government against a United Nations report condemning Mexico for its use of torture on suspects in detention. Thirteen months ago, Mr. Peña Nieto appointed him to head the Social Development Ministry, a post that elevated Mr. Meade to the level of a possible presidential candidate as he traveled around the country promoting the government’s programs for the poor.",0
35461, Maine’s Gov. LePage OWNED On Live Radio By Woman Who Has No Insurance Thanks To Him,"Maine s Governor Paul LePage is a Tea Party idiot who refused Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, and all the federal funding that comes with it. The Medicaid expansion part of Obamacare was designed to help people obtain coverage who earned too little to qualify for insurance on the exchanges, but too much to qualify for Medicaid. LePage screwed over tens of thousands of Maine residents with his decision, and one woman was not going to let him get away with it if she could help it.The woman, who was identified as Laura, falls into that gap between qualifying for Obamacare and qualifying for Medicaid. She called in while LePage was being interviewed on Maine Public Radio specifically to blast him on behalf of the 60,000 Maine residents who are still without health insurance because of him: I m actually one of the people affected by the health care issue in Maine, so LePage is wrong in saying that people aren t affected or that wouldn t get the insurance. I would get the insurance if we accepted that money federally. LePage has been perpetuating the lies that no coverage gap actually exists, and that Maine wouldn t qualify for federal funds anyway because their Medicaid program accepts people with incomes of up to 200 percent of the federal poverty line. So, of course, he insulted Laura by asking her why she doesn t qualify for Medicaid. Her response was: I make too little money to be on Obamacare. It s expected that if you go to Obamacare that you re going to make a certain amount of money so you can afford the premiums. But if you make $11,500 a year To that, LePage replied that she does qualify for Medicaid, and she retorted: You don t get Medicaid unless you re pregnant, disabled or over 55. This woman is a social worker, so her job includes helping people get access to certain things, including Medicaid. Therefore, she would know this stuff far better than the oppose-Obama-at-all-costs Tea Partier that s in the Governor s Mansion there. The fact that she herself makes too much money to qualify for Medicaid, but too little for Obamacare, was the final nail in the coffin of that conversation.Here s why: LePage s office was hilariously forced to release a statement later in the day admitting that the governor was wrong about the qualifications for Medicaid and the expansion. The state, because of its law, would not qualify for the full 100 percent of federal reimbursement for the first three years, and then the 90 percent every year after that for people between 100 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty line. It qualifies for 62 percent reimbursement there.However, for the 60,000 Maine residents who currently fall into the coverage gap, Maine would qualify for the full federal reimbursement. So Laura triumphantly destroyed LePage s own talking points on the air, forcing his office to clarify things for listeners later on.How embarrassing. We re laughing so hard it hurts.Featured image by MattGagnon. Licensed under Public Domain via Commons",1

60505,"Japanese Boy, 7, Left on Mountain by Parents Is Found Alive - The New York Times","TOKYO  —   A    Japanese boy who disappeared nearly a week ago after his parents left him on the side of a mountain road to discipline him was found unharmed on Friday, the Japanese authorities said. The boy, Yamato Tanooka, wandered onto a military base about three miles from where he was left on Saturday on the northern island of Hokkaido. He was found early Friday morning by soldiers on a training exercise, exhausted but apparently uninjured, the local police said. The boy’s parents have faced harsh public criticism over the case, which has been covered intensively by the Japanese news media since his disappearance. “I’m full of gratitude. From now on, I’m going to take better care of him as he grows up,” Yamato’s father, Takayuki Tanooka, 44, said in comments on NHK, the national broadcaster. Some 200 police officers and volunteer rescue workers had been searching for the boy. The parents initially told the police that their son had become separated from them while they were picking wild vegetables in the mountains. But they later changed their story, saying they had left their son on the side of the road as punishment for throwing stones at cars and people while they were on an outing. They said they had driven off in their car, intending to scare him. But when they went back a short time later, the boy was gone. The police have not indicated whether they intend to pursue criminal charges against the parents. Three soldiers from the Japanese Ground   Force found the boy in a cabin on the remote wooded military base on Friday morning, said Hiroki Komori, a spokesman for the 11th Brigade of the Northern Army, which trains there. The soldiers had ducked into the cabin to avoid a rain shower, Mr. Komori said. The soldiers gave the boy rice balls and tea from a canteen, Mr. Komori said. He was taken to Hakodate Municipal Hospital by ambulance. Japanese news reports said the boy had probably been sheltering for days in the cabin. He told the authorities that he had found his way to the area soon after his parents left him and had been subsisting only on water from a nearby stream, reports said. Commentary about the case on social media has been overwhelmingly critical toward the parents. “This isn’t discipline, it’s child abuse,” Kenichiro Mogi, a   neurologist, author and television personality, wrote on Twitter on Monday. “It’s the boy’s father who has learned the big lesson,” another social media user said after he was found on Friday. A few said the parents had simply mishandled an otherwise acceptable form of punishment. Some said they had been subjected to the same treatment from their own parents after misbehaving as children. “I understand, I really do, but they should at least have kept an eye on him from behind some trees,” one Twitter post from Sunday read. “There are bears in Hokkaido. ”",0
4986,EU suspends funding for Cambodian election,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - The European Union has suspended funding for Cambodia s 2018 general election because the vote cannot be credible after the dissolution of the main opposition party, according to a letter sent to the national election committee on Tuesday. The Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved by the country s highest court last month at the request of the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen after the arrest of opposition leader Kem Sokha for alleged treason.  An electoral process from which the main opposition party has been arbitrarily excluded cannot be seen as legitimate,  the letter said.  Under these circumstances, the European Union does not believe there is a possibility of a credible electoral process.  Some Western donors have condemned the CNRP dissolution as the most serious blow to democracy since an international peace deal and U.N.-run elections in the early 1990s ended decades of war and the Khmer Rouge genocide that killed at least 1.8 million Cambodians in the 1970s. A government spokesman said the EU decision would not affect the election, in which Hun Sen is expected to extend more than three decades in office that make him the world s longest serving prime minister.  This is their will,  spokesman Phay Siphan told Reuters on Tuesday.  We have our own money.   The European Union and Japan are the biggest donors to Cambodia s election commission, which is in theory independent. Asked if Japan would also suspend aid for the election, the Japanese embassy said it would continue to give assistance for electoral reform and would monitor the situation closely.  It is of utmost importance to have next year s national election reflect the will of the Cambodian people,  Hironori Suzuki, a counselor at the embassy, told Reuters by email. The United States last month said it would suspend funding for the election. It later said it would impose visa sanctions on those involved in the government s actions to undermine democracy.  Kem Sokha, leader of the CNRP, was arrested for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government with U.S. help. He has rejected the accusation as a political ploy. The European Union in October warned Cambodia it could face EU action over duty-free access it enjoys under a deal for some of the world s poorest countries if the nation s human rights situation deteriorates further. Cambodia s biggest donor and investor is now China, which has voiced support for the opposition crackdown, saying it supports government efforts to ensure stability and economic development. ",0
14150,Grassroots Coalition Shares ‘Many Questions and Concerns About Betsy DeVos’ with Senators,"An education watch coalition of grassroots parents and other citizens representing 27 states is letting the Senate know its concerns about education department secretary nominee Betsy DeVos. [With DeVos’ confirmation hearing rescheduled to begin January 17, members of Education Liberty Watch have sent a letter detailing their concerns to Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee chairman Sen. Lamar Alexander ( ) ranking member Sen. Patty Murray ( ) and the committee’s other members.  “This national coalition of grassroots parent and citizen organizations has many questions and concerns about Betsy DeVos,” the group’s president, Dr. Karen Effrem, tells Breitbart News. “Chief among them is her apparent very recent conversion to opposing Common Core when her activist and philanthropic record shows concrete evidence of strong support for the standards over many years. ” While, upon her nomination, DeVos launched a new website on which she stated she is “certainly” not a supporter of Common Core, she has served on boards and funded organizations that have been vocal supporters of the standards. Additionally, she has been strongly endorsed by former GOP presidential candidate and Common Core promoter Jeb Bush, his mother, former First Lady Barbara Bush, former GOP presidential nominee and “ ” Mitt Romney, former education secretary William Bennett  —   who received compensation for promoting Common Core among conservatives, the   Core Michigan Chamber of Commerce, and the Bill   Fordham Institute, which has also promoted Common Core. “There is also great concern about her support of voucher programs imposing Common Core on private and potentially home schools, and extensive student data mining,” Effrem continues. “These concerns are especially acute given   Trump’s encouraging and repeated promises to get rid of Common Core, protect privacy and decrease or eliminate the federal role in education. ” Effrem summarizes the letter and the group’s concerns: 1) From all the evidence we can find, her statement when she was appointed on November 23rd was her very first against Common Core. Her statements and record via organizations that she has founded, funded, chaired, or on whose boards she has served and her political contributions have all been in support of Common Core and   Core candidates. Her statement and her interview with Donald Trump focused on “higher standards” which is a euphemism for Common Core, even though there is abundant evidence that the Common Core standards are anything but high. 2) Her American Federation for Children group has been strongly in support of state voucher laws in Indiana and Louisiana or federal Title I portability that imposes or would impose Common Core on private schools via the federally mandated state assessments. The education savings accounts that she touts could well place government regulations on home schooling for “accountability” purposes. 3) Although a strong supporter of charter schools, it appears she has never financially supported classical charter schools like the Hillsdale model in her own home state, only charters that require the teaching and testing of Common Core. 4) The Philanthropy Roundtable that she chaired until her appointment put out a report that is strongly in favor of extensive data mining of children without transparency of what data is collected and who receives it or parental consent and never mentions the word “privacy. ” 5) We are also concerned about continued expansion of invasive, subjective social emotional learning programs at the federal level and need to know her position on those. “We strongly urge the Senate HELP Committee to closely question her about these critical issues,” Effrem says.

While Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton just before the Democratic National Convention in July, many of his supporters remained adamant in their refusal to support the DNC-anointed candidate, pointing to WikiLeaks’ revelations that top officials at the DNC had been working behind the scenes to tip the scales in Clinton’s favor by coordinating with media figures to circulate anti-Sanders narratives. 
Rather than attribute a potential Trump presidency to the GOP nominee’s perceived popularity among voters, the closeness of this election could be credited to Hillary Clinton’s unfavorable ratings. According to RealClearPolitics, anywhere between 51 and 57 percent of voters had a negative opinion of the Democratic nominee. 
As of 11 PM Eastern, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin remain too close to call. Clinton has 197 electoral votes to Trump’s 187.

21475,U.S. lawmakers raise privacy concerns over new hacking rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the U.S. Congress on Thursday asked the Justice Department to clarify how a looming rule change to the government’s hacking powers could impact privacy rights of innocent Americans. The change, due to take place on December 1, would let judges issue search warrants for remote access to computers located in any jurisdiction, potentially including foreign countries. Magistrate judges can normally only order searches within the jurisdiction of their court, which is typically limited to a few counties. “We are concerned about the full scope of the new authority that would be provided to the Department of Justice,” 23 senators and representatives wrote to Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The Supreme Court in April approved amendments to Rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure that would allow judges to issue warrants in cases when a suspect uses anonymizing technology to conceal the location of his or her computer or for an investigation into a network of hacked or infected computers, such as a botnet.  Those amendments will take effect on December 1 of this year unless Congress passes legislation that would reject, amend or postpone the changes. Some lawmakers, led by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, have introduced legislation that would halt the changes, but it has yet to gain much traction. In their letter, the lawmakers asked how the government would prevent under the expanded rule so-called “forum shopping,” where prosecutors seek warrants in districts considered more favorable to law enforcement.  They also asked how the Justice Department intends to notify users when electronic devices have been searched and whether law enforcement has the authority to disable malicious software on a protected device, including those belonging to innocent Americans, among other questions.  The Justice Department has worked on Rule 41 changes for years, arguing they are procedural in nature and necessary to keep pace with criminal threats posed by evolving technology. Civil liberties groups and some technology companies, including Alphabet Inc’s Google, have said the changes could allow for searches that run afoul of privacy rights. The Justice Department is reviewing the lawmakers’ letter, which asked for a response within two weeks, spokesman Peter Carr said. ",0
59800,Donald Trump Calls Allegations by Women ‘False Smears’ - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump implored supporters on Thursday to rally behind him by portraying himself as a victim of “false smears” from a growing number of women accusing him of making unwanted advances  —   a brazen attempt to stabilize his campaign amid a new round of criticism from Republican allies and a searing denunciation by Michelle Obama. By Thursday night, at least six women had publicly accused Mr. Trump of groping and forcibly kissing them over the decades, a pattern of sexual assault that he denied in the presidential debate on Sunday after bragging about such behavior in a 2005 recording that was unearthed last week. Mr. Trump dismissed all the allegations on Thursday and even lashed out at one of the women, a former writer for People magazine, seemingly implying that she was not attractive enough for him. “Look at her  —   look at her words,” Mr. Trump said at a rally in West Palm Beach, Fla. “I don’t think so. ” The allegations about Mr. Trump’s treatment of women became the   focus of the political world, a remarkable turn as the sexual history of a presidential nominee became a dominant and unavoidable issue in the final weeks of the race. Rarely, too, has a candidate in a general election so darkly insinuated that a conspiracy of forces was trying to undermine him and his admirers, as Mr. Trump did Thursday at events in the battleground states of Florida and Ohio. With Hillary Clinton assuming a low profile on Thursday to keep the public focus on Mr. Trump, Mrs. Obama drew wide praise from Democrats and on social media for her intensely personal remarks about the revulsion and depression that she felt over Mr. Trump’s comments about women. Speaking to several hundred voters and students at Southern New Hampshire University, Mrs. Obama said she could not “stop thinking about this  —   it has shaken me to my core. ” “This is disgraceful, it is intolerable, and it doesn’t matter what party you belong to,” Mrs. Obama said. “No woman deserves to be treated this way  —   none of us deserves this kind of abuse. ” The New York Times reported on Wednesday night that two women said Mr. Trump had touched them inappropriately, forcefully groping or kissing them. Their stories echoed a 2005 recording on which Mr. Trump boasts of being able to sexually assault women because of his celebrity. Other news organizations, including The Palm Beach Post, BuzzFeed and People magazine, also reported on women who had troubling encounters with Mr. Trump, who said at the debate Sunday that he had never acted on his “locker room talk” in the 2005 recording. In a series of messages posted on Twitter on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump called the Times article a “total fabrication” and denied charges by the People magazine writer, Natasha Stoynoff, that he had forced his tongue down her throat while she was working on an assignment about his first anniversary with his wife, Melania. But at his rallies in West Palm Beach and later in Cincinnati, Mr. Trump also unveiled a new campaign strategy, beseeching his supporters to view him as a political martyr for their cause and stick by him in the face of ugly accusations about his personal conduct. “I take all of these slings and arrows, gladly, for you,” Mr. Trump said to cheers in West Palm Beach. “I take them for our movement, so that we can have our country back. Our great civilization here in America and across the civilized world has come upon a moment of reckoning. ” Mr. Trump said that “a conspiracy against you, the American people” was underfoot, charging that the Clinton campaign, the news media and other forces were trying to vilify parts of the electorate that did not share their views. “The establishment and their media neighbors wield control over this nation through means that are very well known  —   anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe and morally deformed,” Mr. Trump said. “They will seek to destroy everything about you, including your reputation. They will lie, lie, lie, and then again, they will do worse than that. They will do whatever’s necessary. ” And he spoke about how Mrs. Clinton had met “in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U. S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her   friends and her donors,” phrasing that drew criticism from the   League as reminiscent of historical slurs against Jews. Mr. Trump also warned through his lawyer that he might sue The Times for libel if it did not retract the article and apologize. “Your article is reckless, defamatory and constitutes libel per se,” Marc E. Kasowitz, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, wrote in a letter to The Times. “It is apparent from, among other things, the timing of the article, that it is nothing more than a politically motivated effort to defeat Mr. Trump’s candidacy. ” David E. McCraw, vice president and assistant general counsel for the Times, wrote to Mr. Kasowitz that the newspaper “did what the law allows: We published newsworthy information about a subject of deep public concern. ” “If Mr. Trump disagrees, if he believes that American citizens had no right to hear what these women had to say and that the law of this country forces us and those who would dare to criticize him to stand silent or be punished, we welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight,” Mr. McCraw wrote. The Clinton campaign said that the latest allegations showed that Mr. Trump was unfit to be president and that he lied in the debate Sunday. Mrs. Clinton, at a   in San Francisco on Thursday, leveled a broad attack on Mr. Trump over his past insults and treatment of people. “It’s more than just the way he degrades women, as horrible as that is,” she said. “He has attacked immigrants,   Latinos, people with disabilities, P. O. W. s, Muslims and our military, which he’s called a disaster. There’s hardly any part of America that he’s not targeted. ” At the rally in New Hampshire, Mrs. Obama was particularly withering about how Mr. Trump’s treatment of women was, in her view, a sign of weakness. “We simply cannot endure this or expose our children to it any longer, not for another minute, let alone another four years,” the first lady said. “Now is the time to stand up and say, Enough is enough. ” The Trump campaign has been thrown into turmoil by the allegations and the damage that the recording has done to his standing among women and with the Republican leaders who have disavowed him or revoked their endorsements. National and state polls show Mr. Trump’s support has plummeted in the last two weeks. In an effort to turn things around, he has stepped up his personal attacks on Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, over his marital infidelity. Mr. Trump also dispatched his daughter Ivanka to the Pennsylvania suburbs on Thursday in the hope that she could lift his standing in the crucial swing state. Some of Mr. Trump’s staunchest allies have been unusually critical of him during the most difficult stretch of his campaign. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and presidential candidate in 2012 who wanted to be Mr. Trump’s running mate, suggested on Thursday that there were two Donald Trumps. “There’s a big Trump and a little Trump,” he said in an appearance on the Fox Business Network. “The little Trump is frankly pathetic. ” But at Mr. Trump’s rally in West Palm Beach, the candidate’s most ardent fans stood by him. Mr. Trump said that he would soon provide evidence that the allegations of improper behavior were not true. He claimed that the women who were coming forward were not properly vetted and that in some cases their stories did not add up. But it was The Times that was the particular target for his scorn. He said he was preparing to sue and contended that “the great editors of the past from The New York Times and others, ladies and gentleman, are spinning in their grave. ” Mr. Trump appeared to take comfort from the cheering crowd as he lamented the hurtfulness of the attacks he has been facing. Describing the “horror show of lies, deceptions and malicious attacks” Mr. Trump told his supporters: “This election will determine whether we remain a free nation or only the illusion of democracy, but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests, rigging the system and our system is rigged. ”",0
