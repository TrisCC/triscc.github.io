30969, Judge Who Blocked Trump’s Muslim Ban REPEATEDLY Dropped The Mic On DOJ Lawyer Trying To Defend It,"While Trump is whining up a storm on Twitter about how Judge James Robart has made it so anyone can get into the U.S. by halting his Muslim ban, there s a conversation between Robart and Dept. of Justice attorney Michelle Bennett floating around that explains a lot about how Robart sees it.Robart asked Bennett the following pointed question, which everyone with any sense has been asking since Trump threw the world into chaos last week: How many arrests have there been of foreign nationals from those seven countries since 9/11? Bennett replied: Your Honor, I don t have that information. I m from the civil division if that helps get me off the hook. What a thing for a lawyer to say   it almost sounds like Bennett felt a little silly defending Trump s Muslim ban in court. She may have felt even sillier after Robart said: Let me tell you. The answer to that is none, as best I can tell. So, I mean, you re here arguing on behalf of someone that says: We have to protect the United States from these individuals coming from these countries, and there s no support for that. Bennett argued that the rationale behind the order was to protect the U.S. from potential terrorists. Many people think that makes some sense, but neither Trump nor his administration ever weighed that against the possible impact of such a ban. Had any terrorists actually come from any of those countries, and attacked us, then the ban might have some merit.As it stands, though, it exempts countries that actually do have a history of exporting terrorism.Robart responded to Bennett s statement about protecting the U.S. with this: I m also asked to look and determine if the executive order is rationally based. And rationally based, to some extent, means I have to find it grounded in fact instead of fiction. The Muslim ban is currently based on the fiction that these countries pose a clear and present threat. They don t. The  threat  that Trump sees is vague and rooted in paranoia, not fact. Yet Trump is all over Twitter claiming that now  bad people  can just indiscriminately pour into the country as though U.S. Customs and Border Protection was only able to do its job with the ban in effect.He claims to have instructed DHS to very carefully look at people coming into the country, because DHS and CBP apparently weren t doing that. Chances are he did no such thing, or he made them roll their eyes. He ll take credit if nothing happens, and he ll blame Robart if something does.While the Trump administration is certain that they ll win this case and the ban will be reinstated, others aren t so sure. Some think this will go all the way to the Supreme Court, and if it has to, it has to. The harm the ban causes actually outweighs the dangers of not having it in place.Below is a video of the Feb. 3 hearing, and the relevant portion begins at the 38:00 mark:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",1

34602, Even Robert E. Lee’s Great-Great Grandson Wants Statues Torn Down,"While Donald Trump, a man who speaks in hyperbole and absolutes like  bad  and  sad,  is finding it difficult to condemn violent racists, the great-great grandson of Robert E. Lee, the Civil War general whose statue spurred the protest, spoke out against the hatred and said that the statues should be taken down.The violence in Charlotte, Virginia erupted over the weekend during a planned white supremacist protest over the fact the city s plans to remove the statue after the city council voted, saying that the monuments to the Civil War are,  painful reminders of the violence and injustice of slavery and other harms of white supremacy that are best removed from public spaces. There s no place for that,  Robert E. Lee V tells Newsweek, referring to the white supremacist protesters who carried torches and marched through Charlottesville on Friday.  There s no place for that hate. While he didn t mention Trump by name, the younger Lee said that even his great-great grandfather would have done a better job denouncing the Neo-nazis and white supremacists. We don t believe in that whatsoever,  Lee says. He is quick to defend his ancestor s name:  Our belief is that General Lee would not tolerate that sort of behavior either. His first thing to do after the Civil War was to bring the Union back together, so we could become a more unified country. We don t want people to think that they can hide behind Robert E. Lee s name and his life for these senseless acts of violence that occurred on Saturday,  Lee says.As for whether the statues should remain, Lee says yes, but in proper context. I think that is absolutely an option, to move it to a museum and put it in the proper historical context,  Lee says.  Times were very different then. We look at the institution of slavery, and it s absolutely horrendous. Back then, times were just extremely different. We understand that it s complicated in 2017, when you look back at that period of time  If you want to put statues of General Lee or other Confederate people in museums, that makes good sense. In other words, much like Holocaust memorials, memorials to the most divisive, cruel and violent time in American History should be educational and cautionary, not something to be worshiped.It s pretty clear that Lee is right about what his ancestor and namesake would have thought. It s well documented that even the original Robert E. Lee didn t want the Civil War memorialized. He wanted the nation to heal. I think it wiser,  the retired military leader wrote about a proposed Gettysburg memorial in 1869,  not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered.

15153,Krauthammer on Bannon at CPAC: He Showed He Was ’the Brains of the Operation’ - Breitbart,"Thursday on Fox News Channel’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer reacted to the joint appearance of White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and chief of staff Reince Priebus earlier in the day at the Conservative Political Action Conference.  Krauthammer told host Tucker Carlson the focus on reports of friction between the two was “trivial” and that Bannon’s first public appearance since inauguration was the real tell because he described Bannon as “the brains of the operation. ” “I think they’re going to bat down these stories in the media that there is a terrible conflict going on all the time,” Krauthammer said. “I think they felt that there is the first order of business, I think it’s somewhat trivial because it was a very substantive exchange and from Bannon who we’ve not heard of since the swearing in, it was extremely revealing. This is the brains of the operation. This is the guy who thinks strategically, and large categories, and he laid them out. I thought that was the most interesting part, and unfortunately, it got the least amount of coverage. ” Carlson asked Krauthammer to elaborate on that strategy, which Krauthammer broke down to three “overarching” ideas  —   international relations, trade, and the “administrative state. ” “His representation of Trump is that you can never get out of Reince or out of Trump,” he said. “He basically said there are three overarching ideas. One is the international arena. We are going to break that down, where essentially, you got this in the inaugural address, the world and our allies have been parasitic on us years with alliances and trade and multilateral trade, where done with that  —   America first. That’s number one. The second is what he calls economic nationalism  —   meaning trade and immigration. We are looking at America first regarding the economy. The third is the destruction of the administration administrative state. ” “Now, on the third one, I think you can get a consensus among all conservatives, and I think we’re all rooting that on,” Krauthammer continued. “And I think the first salvo in that war happened yesterday when the Trump administration reversed the bathroom bill that had been issued by the Obama in administration, which whatever your ideas about transgender sexuality, it is not the province of the federal government. It has nothing to do with the overblown leviathan state. It’s a way to say we’re going to smash all this and we’re going to eliminate this sort of excess. That’s Reaganism, that’s hardcore Reaganism, the regulatory rollback. On the other two, this is going against the tradition of the last 30 years. And he will run into trouble, especially on the second having to do with trade in Congress. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0

14468,What Donald Trump Might Do for Working-Class Families - The New York Times,"Among the rare areas of agreement in the aftermath of a contentious presidential election: Families with working parents, especially those with lower incomes, are having too hard a time. Many can no longer count on lives that look like the ones their parents led.   manufacturing jobs have been disappearing, especially for men. Fewer people are marrying, and more children are growing up in unstable families. Parents are struggling to work while raising children.   Donald J. Trump vowed to help the working class, and   whites in particular helped propel him to victory. Although quite a few economists disagree with him on the merits of his prescriptions, he has said cutting taxes, restricting immigration and renegotiating trade deals will ultimately raise incomes of struggling families. Mr. Trump has said he understands the needs of working parents. “These solutions must update laws passed more than half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force,” he said in September in a speech unveiling his child care proposals. His daughter Ivanka has pushed ideas like paid leave and seems to be taking a role in devising new policies. In a statement last week, she said she was distancing herself from certain aspects of her company in order to “broaden her efforts to take a stance on issues of critical importance to American women and families. ” Which policies will Mr. Trump pursue to directly address the needs of working and   families? A look at what he has said  —   along with the wish lists of Republicans in Congress, scholars and advisers  —   provides some clues. A striking thing happened during the campaign: For the first time, both Republican and Democratic candidates made paid family leave a part of their policy agenda. As recently as 2014, Hillary Clinton said of paid leave, “I don’t think, politically, we could get it now. ” Now it could find bipartisan support. Mr. Trump has proposed six weeks of paid maternity leave, which he said would offer “a crucial safety net for working mothers. ” Currently, 87 percent of workers get no paid family leave, and 95 percent of those in the lowest quarter of earners get none, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Most Americans support a paid leave policy. It can ease the burdens on families with two working parents and increase the likelihood that parents stay in the labor force. Still, the details could prove contentious. Should fathers also get leave, or just mothers? What about gay or adoptive parents, and people who need to care for sick children or aging relatives? And how should it be paid for? Mr. Trump’s proposal would apply only to new mothers, and he said he would pay for it with savings from reducing unemployment insurance fraud, though it’s unclear how that would work. The Family Act, a   bill stalled in Congress, proposes paying for it with a small increase in payroll taxes. Republicans have previously proposed giving businesses a tax credit for providing paid leave, but making it voluntary. “If he structures it in a way that it’s not a burden on businesses and does not work against women’s work force participation, I think more Republicans will get behind it,” said Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar in economic policy at the American Enterprise Institute. Democrats have argued that by limiting parental leave to new mothers, Mr. Trump ignores the role fathers play in raising children, exposes women to discrimination in hiring and neglects the needs of people with ailing or elderly family members. “It was fantastic to see the Republicans stepping up and having this debate,” said Heather Boushey, the executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, who was the chief economist for Hillary Clinton’s transition team. “It really spoke to how important these issues are in terms of economic policy. But I hope that the actual policies are really grounded more in the evidence of what works than what he’s put out so far. ” Another policy that analysts say is important to   families is paid sick leave, so that workers can care for themselves or for ill family members. It’s unclear whether Mr. Trump will push for it.   percent of workers over all and 66 percent of those in the bottom quartile of income get no paid sick leave. Some Republicans have instead proposed letting certain workers  —   those in the private sector who are not exempt from overtime laws  —   substitute time off for overtime pay. Another Democratic dream that Mr. Trump raised on the campaign trail was financial help for child care. “For many families in our country, child care is now the single largest expense, even more than housing, yet very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area,” he said in September. His proposal would allow parents earning less than $250, 000 individually or $500, 000 jointly to deduct the average cost of child and elder care from their income taxes. In a nod to social conservatives, he said parents who stayed home with children would also get the child care tax deduction. “The idea here is letting the family choose how the money is spent,” said Bradford Wilcox, director of the national marriage project at the University of Virginia. For   families, Mr. Trump proposed child care spending rebates as part of the   tax credit. He also said he would make pretax dependent care savings accounts available to everyone, not just people whose employers offer them, and give tax deductions to employers that offer   child care. Democrats have favored refundable tax credits over deductions because they say they are more helpful to   families, who might not make enough to pay income taxes. Also, credits directly reduce someone’s tax bill, while deductions reduce taxable income but not necessarily the final bill. Democrats see the ultimate goal as   universal care for young children. There seems to be bipartisan support for a small step in that direction. “What we’ve got there is a tremendous amount of support from women  —   Democrats, Republicans, independents  —   to move forward,” said Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee. Mr. Trump has pledged to create 25 million jobs over the next decade. Analysts and policy makers on both sides of the aisle say one route toward that goal is apprenticeships. They are viewed as a way for people to acquire vocational skills while earning money, as opposed to attending college and building up debt. Not only would they address unemployment among people without college degrees, advocates say, but they could also lead to more stable families. The unemployment of   men has been a prime reason for the decline in marriage and rise in single motherhood, researchers have found. When job opportunities are plentiful, people are more likely to marry before having their first child, Andrew Cherlin, a professor of public policy at Johns Hopkins, found in a study published in August in the American Sociological Review. “It’s likely if we can improve the job picture for   young adults, they’d have family lives that are more stable,” he said. The construction industry already uses apprentices, so perhaps Mr. Trump is familiar with their benefits, said Robert I. Lerman, a fellow at the Urban Institute. They would be possible in a range of   industries, like health care and information technology, he said, and in   jobs like hotel management. They could also be useful in putting people to work building the new infrastructure that Mr. Trump has promised. “People want to have earnings, they want to have dignity, they want to show that they’ve been able to master a certain profession, and that gives them a kind of identity,” Mr. Lerman said. “It has both a social as well as an economic dimension. ” Though the idea has received bipartisan support, some Republicans have resisted registered apprenticeships, which are overseen by the Labor Department, because of their association with unions. Some Democrats have questioned whether apprenticeships lead to a   wage system, and have focused instead on making college accessible to more people. Policy makers and researchers have a long list of other policy ideas for Mr. Trump that they believe could help   families. Some have historically appealed to Republicans, like those that encourage marriage. Others, like mandating predictable work schedules for hourly workers, have been promoted by Democrats. With both parties fighting even more for the allegiance of the working class, there actually might be some movement on some or all of these issues.",0
18730,TRUMP WAS RIGHT About CNN Being “Very Fake News”: Federal Judge Rules Against CNN In “FAKE NEWS” Case…May Have Acted With “Actual Malice”,"Everyone laughing after Trump rebranded CNN as #VeryFakeNews. Then they go on their networks saying how ""dangerous"" and ""not funny"" it was   pic.twitter.com/d3IiaVh5VL  Asa J   (@asamjulian) February 17, 2017Those who accuse CNN and other mainstream media outlets of  fake news  will probably revel in a recent decision by a federal judge in Atlanta, Georgia. While Judge Orinda Evans didn t all out declare that CNN was peddling in falsehoods, she did take aim at the network in an initial judgment in favor of a former hospital CEO who sued CNN accusing them of purposely skewing statistics to reflect poorly on a West Palm Beach hospital. Judge Evans didn t mince words in her 18-page order allowing the case to move forward, and dismissing CNN s attempt to get it thrown out of court.Davide Carbone, former CEO of St. Mary s Medical Center in West Palm Beach, filed a defamation lawsuit against CNN after they aired what he claims were a  series of false and defamatory news reports  regarding the infant mortality rate at the hospital. CNN s report said the mortality rate was three times the national average. However, Mr. Carbone contends that CNN  intentionally  manipulated statistics to bolster their report. He also claims that CNN purposely ignored information that would look favorable to the hospital in order to sensationalize the story. In our case, we contended that CNN essentially made up its own standard in order to conduct an  apples to oranges  comparison to support its false assertion that St. Mary s mortality rate was 3 times higher than the national average. Accordingly, the case against CNN certainly fits the description of media-created  Fake News.  said Carbone s attorney L. Lin Wood, in a statement to LawNewz.com.Wood says that as a result of CNN s story Carbone lost his job and it became extremely difficult for him to find new employment in the field of hospital administration. False and defamatory accusations against real people have serious consequences. Neither St. Mary s or Mr. Carbone did anything to deserve being the objects of the heinous accusation that they harmed or put babies and young children at risk for profit,  Wood said.On Wednesday, Federal District Judge Orinda Evans ruled that the case could move forward, even ruling that she found that CNN may have acted with  actual malice  with the report   a standard necessary to prove a defamation claim. The Court finds these allegations sufficient to establish that CNN was acting recklessly with regard to the accuracy of its report, i.e., with  actual malice,  the order reads. CNN had tried to get the case dismissed.  LawNewz",1
25155,U.S. Seeks Death for Charleston Shooting Suspect. Victims’ Families Prefer Mercy. - The New York Times,"CHARLESTON, S. C.  —   The Rev. Sharon Risher often thinks these days about what she calls her “humanness”: the passing impulse to crave the execution of the white supremacist accused of killing her mother and eight other black churchgoers last year. “My humanness is being broken, my humanness of wanting this man to be broken beyond punishment,” Ms. Risher said. “You can’t do that if you really say that you believe in the Bible and you believe in Jesus Christ. You can’t just waver. ” But after delays, the Federal District Court here will begin on Monday the long process of individually questioning prospective jurors for the capital trial of Dylann S. Roof, who is charged with 33 federal counts, including hate crimes, in the June 17, 2015, killings at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Mr. Roof, whom a judge on Friday declared competent to stand trial, has offered, in exchange for a sentence of life in prison, to plead guilty. The government has refused to make such a plea agreement. The   path to Mr. Roof’s first death penalty trial  —   the state of South Carolina is also seeking his execution  —   has been marked by public demonstrations of forgiveness and reconciliation. But the federal government’s decision to pursue Mr. Roof’s execution is widely questioned, and it is in defiance of the wishes and recommendations of survivors of the attack, many family members of the dead and some Justice Department officials. Even South Carolina’s acrimonious debate about the display of the Confederate battle flag outside the State House was less divisive in this state, polling shows. In May, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced her decision to seek the death penalty against Mr. Roof, and critics of that choice make different, if sometimes overlapping, arguments. Some are opposed to capital punishment in every instance because they doubt its efficacy or morality. Others argue that because a death sentence for Mr. Roof would prompt years of appeals, the decision can only protract the emotional agony of a massacre that rattled the nation. And still others contend that executing a young man like Mr. Roof, who is 22, could allow him to escape decades of punishment. “I want that guy every morning when he wakes up, and every time he has an opportunity for quiet and solitude, to think of what Tywanza said to him: ‘We mean you no harm. You don’t have to do this,’” said Andrew J. Savage III, a Charleston lawyer, referring to Tywanza Sanders, a    man who died in the attack. Mr. Savage represents three survivors, including Mr. Sanders’s mother, and many family members of the victims who became known here as the Emanuel Nine. But Ms. Lynch chose to seek the death penalty after a contentious review process that included South Carolina’s top federal prosecutor siding with Mr. Roof’s defense lawyers in their offer of a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence. Ms. Lynch said that “the nature of the alleged crime and the resulting harm compelled this decision. ” In a court filing the same day the attorney general made her decision public, the Justice Department cited nine aggravating factors, including that Mr. Roof had “expressed hatred and contempt towards   as well as other groups, and his animosity toward   played a role in the murder charges in the indictment. ” Prosecutors also said that Mr. Roof had “demonstrated a lack of remorse” and that he had caused “injury, harm and loss to the individuals that he killed as well as to the family, friends and   of those individuals. ” The Justice Department declined to comment further for this article. Although Ms. Lynch’s decision capped a process formally shrouded in secrecy, it was an unsurprising one to observers like Ms. Risher, who said she had felt as early as last December that prosecutors would seek the death penalty in one of the highest profile criminal matters before the Justice Department. The case’s prominence influenced Ms. Lynch’s decision, according to people with knowledge of the Justice Department’s review, and some federal officials worried that forgoing the death penalty would effectively curb the government’s options in future cases with lower fatality counts and less public scrutiny. Some of the people insisted on anonymity to discuss a confidential process. “I think what the federal government did is what the federal government thought it had to do, which was speak on behalf of the nation,” Mr. Savage said. “I was always told, ‘Well, Andy, if we don’t move for the death penalty in this case, when would we? ’” Such a strategy, he suggested, was to the detriment of the families of the victims. “It’s bad enough to live with it in 2015, 2016 and 2017,” he said. “But don’t make them carry that legal cause on for 20 years. ” There were other arguments, too. When the Attorney General’s Review Committee on Capital Cases met in Washington to hear from a defense lawyer  —   David I. Bruck  —   and William N. Nettles, then the United States attorney for South Carolina, they were told that a federal death penalty trial would be duplicative of local efforts and turn greater public attention to Mr. Roof. “I felt when I was the United States attorney that the job  —   and I used to preach this over and over again  —   was to step in when the state was either unwilling or unable,” said Mr. Nettles, who left the Justice Department in June. “The state was both willing and able to address this issue. ” Mr. Nettles otherwise declined to discuss the case. Mr. Bruck declined to comment. Members of Mr. Roof’s family have refused to discuss the case, but they said in a statement this month that they were “still struggling to understand why Dylann caused so much grief and pain to so many good people. ” The question of whether Mr. Roof should face execution surfaced soon after the killings, which happened during a Wednesday night Bible study at the whitewashed, historic church on Calhoun Street. Within 48 hours of the shootings, and less than a day after Mr. Roof was arrested, Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina said on television that she “absolutely will want him to have the death penalty. ” A University of South Carolina survey, conducted last spring, found that 55 percent of South Carolina residents supported a death sentence for Mr. Roof. But divisions among black and white residents were stark: The poll showed that only 31 percent of black residents wanted Mr. Roof to face execution, while some 64 percent of whites backed the use of capital punishment in the case. Ms. Risher knows about the divides. And as she anxiously waited for Mr. Roof’s trial to begin, she kept returning to the many flashes of doubt she has endured about her own beliefs about Mr. Roof’s fate. “I just start talking to God,” she said. “Hell, I might start screaming at God. I just go there because I know I have to go there because I can’t hold onto that. ”",0

588,Second prototype of China's C919 jet conducts test flight: state TV,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A second prototype of China s home-built C919 passenger jet took off for a test flight in Shanghai on Sunday, state television reported, another step forward in the country s ambitions to muscle in to the global jet market. A total of six prototypes will eventually conduct test flights, China Central Television reported, with engine tests to be a particular focus. The aim was to conduct another long-distance test flight in late January, chief engineer Wang Wei was quoted as saying. More than 1,000 tests would be carried out. The narrow-body aircraft, which will compete with Boeing s 737 and the Airbus A320, is a symbol of China s ambitions to penetrate the global passenger jet market, estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years. The C919 made its maiden flight on May 5 after numerous delays. Analysts have questioned the long periods between previous test flights. It completed its first long-distance flight on Nov. 10, flying for 2 hours and 23 minutes from Shanghai to the central Chinese city of Xi an, covering more than 1,300 km (800 miles) and reaching an altitude of 7,800 meters (25,590 feet). Its manufacturer, the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL], called the maiden flight a milestone that  marked the plane s move into an airworthiness certification phase. COMAC is aiming to obtain certification for the plane from Chinese regulators as well as Europe s aviation safety regulator, which agreed in April to start the certification process. The plane has dozens of customers who have placed orders and commitments for 785 jets, COMAC has said. ",0
35669,Trump team promises to address ethics concerns on businesses,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump will work to ensure there is “proper separation” between his business empire and his job as president of the United States, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on Sunday, amid fresh concerns about conflict of interest following a meeting with Indian real estate executives. Trump, who has said he planned to turn over handling of the Trump Organization to his adult children, has come under criticism for meeting on Tuesday with three Indian businessmen who are partners in a project to build a Trump-branded luxury apartment complex in Mumbai. Pence said on the CBS program “Face the Nation” that Trump and his family would “work with the best legal minds in this country and create the proper separation from their business enterprise during his duties as president of the United States.” A photo of the three executives meeting with Trump was posted on Twitter. Indian newspapers reported last week that the business leaders talked with the Trump Organization about expanding the Trump branded projects in India. Incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union” program, said Trump would comply with all laws and have the White House counsel’s office “review all of these things.” “And we will have every ‘I’ dotted and every ‘T’ crossed, and I can assure the American people that there wouldn’t be any wrongdoing, or any sort of undue influence over any decision-making,” Priebus said. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said his businesses will be overseen by his three grown children, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump. Priebus was asked if it was appropriate for family members to sit in on official meetings after Ivanka Trump attended her father’s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday. “Donald Trump has been very clear from the very beginning that his family is very important to him,” Priebus said on CNN.

18232,Congo opposition rejects new timetable for polls to replace Kabila,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo s main opposition parties have rejected a new date for elections announced at the weekend to replace President Joseph Kabila, saying it violates the law and a political deal agreed with the government. Originally scheduled for late 2016, the polls have been repeatedly delayed. Following several rounds of deadly protests, Kabila s camp and his opponents signed an accord last December agreeing to hold the election before the end of this year. On Sunday, Congo s CENI elections commission announced that the election, which term limits currently bar Kabila from taking part in, will be held on Dec. 23, 2018 with the winner to be sworn in on Jan. 13, 2019.  The calendar presented by the CENI violates the Constitution, the Dec. 31, 2016 accord and electoral law,  read a statement from opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi s Rassemblement coalition.  The document was also agreed to by the MLC and UNC opposition parties. Dozens died in protests against Kabila s refusal to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate last December. Unrest sparked by the uncertainty surrounding the polls has raised fears Congo could witness a repeat of the kind of violence that killed millions around the turn of the last century, mostly from hunger and disease.  After the CENI said last month that the vote could only take place in April 2019 at the earliest, the opposition warned that the population would  take matters into its own hands .  The opposition leaders call upon all the Congolese people to be vigilant and mobilized in the aim of freeing up the electoral process by Dec. 31, 2017,  Tuesday s Rassemblement statement said. It nonetheless went on to state that the coalition believed it was possible to hold the vote by June 30 next year at the latest. The CENI and government officials blame poll delays on problems registering millions of voters across the vast Central African nation. The opposition accuses Kabila of manipulating the process to cling to power. ",0
59248,German election chief urges action to ensure vote software can't be hacked,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s election chief has urged state officials to address vulnerabilities in vote collation software, just weeks before a Sept. 24 election that officials fear could be subject to foreign interference. Germans will vote on paper at polling stations or by mail in advance and the ballots will be counted and entered into a computer system, but two news reports published on Thursday cited concerns about the software, particularly the lack of an authentication step when results are transmitted. Die Zeit said Martin Tschirsich, a 29-year-old computer expert, had been able to find passwords on the internet to gain access to the maintenance program for the  PC-Wahl  (PC-Election) software, which would allow it to be manipulated.  The election is not secure. It can be hacked,  he told the weekly newspaper. Similar concerns were raised by another IT expert in the online version of Der Spiegel magazine. The reports come after repeated warnings from government officials that Russia could try to interfere in the election. French and U.S. intelligence officials say Moscow sought to influence recent votes there.  Russia denies the accusations. Responding to the media reports, Federal Election Director Dieter Sarreither said he was familiar with the problems identified and had asked state officials and the software company, vote-iT, to take steps to shore up security. vote-iT had no immediate comment. The measures Sarreither demanded include the mandatory installation of software patches and the development of new steps aimed at ensuring the authenticity of the election results sent digitally, perhaps through telephone calls. That would ensure that any errors in data transmission are recognized and corrected before preliminary election results are released, Sarreither said, adding that actual results could not be manipulated as they were based on paper ballots. The security of the data was more important than the speed with which results were released, his office said. Germany s federal cyber protection agency, BSI, said it had worked closely with election officials and the software manufacturer to improve the security of election results.  In the future, only information technology based on BSI-certified software should be used for election processes,  BSI chief Arne Schoenbohm said. ",0
13644,AHA! FOX HEAD HONCHO RUPERT MURDOCH Ordered FOX Execs To TAKE DOWN TRUMP Last August," If the hierarchy within the Republican Party loses an election to Democrats it s only a lost election; they are still there, and still comfortable even in the minority. However, if the hierarchy within the Republican Party loses an election to Conservatives, they are out of a job    Mark LevinMurdoch was not a fan of Trump s and especially did not like his stance on immigration. (The antipathy was mutual:  Murdoch s been very bad to me,  Trump told me in March.)A few days before the first GOP debate on Fox in August 2015, Murdoch called Ailes at home.  This has gone on long enough,  Murdoch said, according to a person briefed on the conversation.Murdoch told Ailes he wanted Fox s debate moderators   Kelly, Bret Baier, and Chris Wallace   to hammer Trump on a variety of issues. Ailes, understanding the GOP electorate better than most at that point, likely thought it was a bad idea.  Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee,  Ailes told a colleague around this time. But he didn t fight Murdoch on the debate directive.On the night of August 6, in front of 24 million people, the Fox moderators peppered Trump with harder-hitting questions. But it was Kelly s question regarding Trump s history of crude comments about women that created a media sensation. He seemed personally wounded by her suggestion that this spoke to a temperament that might not be suited for the presidency.  I ve been very nice to you, though I could probably maybe not be based on the way you have treated me,  he said pointedly.Read more: Conservative Treehouse",1
71585,Kentucky man arrested in assault on Senator Rand Paul released on bail,"LOUISVILLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A man has been arrested for assaulting U.S. Senator Rand Paul  at his Kentucky home on Friday and causing a “minor injury,” the state police said. Rene Boucher, 59, of Bowling Green, Kentucky, was arrested and charged with one count of fourth-degree assault causing minor injury, the Kentucky State Police said in a statement on Saturday. Paul and Boucher were acquaintances, said Jeremy Hodges, a state police spokesman, who declined to say what led to the incident.  Paul’s office said in a statement the former Republican presidential candidate “was blindsided and the victim of an assault. The assailant was arrested, and it is now a matter for the police. Senator Paul is fine.” His office did not immediately respond to questions about the extent of any injuries the 54-year-old senator may have suffered or the circumstances of the incident. Hodges said Paul’s injuries were minor and did not require transport to a hospital. Boucher was booked into the Warren County Regional Jail. He was released on Saturday after posting a $7,500 bond, Captain Chip Olney of the facility said by phone. Boucher is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, Olney said. It was unclear if Boucher has an attorney, and he could not be reached for comment late on Saturday. Paul, an ophthalmologist, dropped out of the race for president in February 2016 and successfully ran for re-election as a senator. In September, Paul opposed a partial repeal of healthcare reforms adopted under former Democratic President Barack Obama, angering President Donald Trump, a Republican. Paul last month played golf with Trump and discussed tax reform proposals. ",0
22666,Ryan assures U.S. Senate Republicans on skinny Obamacare repeal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan assured five Republican senators on Thursday that if a healthcare bill passes the Senate, he will take it to a conference committee rather than have the House vote on it, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters. Graham, who had vowed to oppose a “skinny” Obamacare repeal bill unless assured by Ryan, said the House speaker told lawmakers that he did not see such legislation as good policy. Asked if he would now vote “yes” on such a bill, Graham said: “Yes. Based on what I heard, I am.”  ",0
63561,WOW! DNC WILL KEEP Dirty Harvey’s Money To Fund Future Democrat Campaigns,"The Democratic National Committee announced Friday that it is still holding onto most of the money it received from Hollywood mogul and alleged sexual harasser Harvey Weinstein.The DNC will donate just ten percent of the almost $300,000 received from Weinstein, money that will go to organizations close to the Democratic Party: EMILY s List, Emerge America, and Higher Heights, all of which predominately help Democratic candidates running for office. The DNC s response to the Harvey Weinstein matter is shockingly bad   even by Washington standards,  Alexandra Smith of the conservative opposition research firm America Rising said.  Donating  a mere 10 percent of the entire Weinstein contribution to another left-leaning political action committee is a complete embarrassment. The mission statement of EMILY s List is:  We elect pro-choice Democratic women to office.  Emerge America adds ethnic diversity to that same basic mission, proclaiming its intent  to increase the number of Democratic women leaders.  Higher Heights goal is to help black women get elected; the Center for Responsive Politics notes that it gives exclusively to Democrats.Some Democratic politicians are donating money received from Weinstein to nonprofits helping victims of sexual violence, while others have remained silent on the matter. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) announced he would donate his Weinstein money to  several charities supporting women  following a Washington Free Beacon report about Democrats  inaction.

47213, WATCH: How Mike Pence Totally Threw Trump Under The Bus At VP Debate (VIDEO),"While it was billed as a one-time-only clash between the vice presidential running mates, the real matchup at the vice presidential debate turned out not to be Mike Pence versus Tim Kaine after all.As this video from the group Correct the Record shows, Mike Pence spent more time slamming positions and statements held by his own running mate, Donald Trump, than either of the members of the Democratic ticket.Here s the video:[ad3media campaign= 1045 ]It was really stunning to see Pence again and again roll his eyes or exhale as Kaine recited Trump s bizarre rhetoric, only to use his response time to completely avoid defending Trump or offering up the most token resistance.It s no wonder that many observing the debate believe Pence s tactics have more to do with a possible presidential run in 2020 than any real interest in being Trump s vice president for 4-8 years.The thinking is that even on a losing ticket, Pence will have the sort of national exposure that would be impossible to earn through any other means. As the most recent Republican primary showed, a big name brand can conquer a field composed of Governors, Senators, and business leaders despite their credentials. Even as a siting governor, Pence would not have somewhere in the realm of 30 million people watching anything he could do as the leader of Indiana compared to number two on the presidential ticket.So while the strategy seems to hurt in the short term   whatever happened to party unity   it may be a play for the so-called  long game  in which Pence has a leg up over the post-Trump GOP field.That being said, it could just be an act of self-preservation on Pence s part. Not allying yourself with the man who attacks Muslims, Christians, and blacks is just good brand management, even though by simply being on the ticket, Pence is giving it validation in all its bigoted glory.Featured image via screen capture",1
16726,"News Report on Global Temperatures Is Wrong, Scientists Say - The New York Times","Scientists on Friday debunked a widely circulated news media report suggesting that recent   global temperatures were unrelated to climate change. The report, which first appeared in The  Mail on Sunday and was summarized in Breitbart News, the   opinion and news site, cited incomplete data and drew incorrect conclusions, the scientists said. Federal and international agencies have said that 2016 will likely be the hottest year on record, eclipsing the record set last year. In its report, The Mail on Sunday cited a recent decline in temperatures over land since the weather phenomenon known as El Niño ended this year, and said that El Niño, and not climate change, was responsible for the record heat. But scientists said that while the recent El Niño did contribute to the record warmth, climate change played a major role, too. “Nobody said the record temperatures were exclusively the result of climate change,” said Mike Halpert, the deputy director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center. Deke Arndt, the chief of the climate monitoring branch at the NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, said that the   warming trend was quite clear, and that the impact of El Niño was in addition to what were already higher temperatures. “You can have both climate change and a goose from El Niño,” he said. In an El Niño, water temperatures increase in the eastern equatorial Pacific, affecting air temperatures and weather worldwide. Sea surface temperatures have declined since their peak earlier this year, and now the opposite condition  —   La Niña, with water temperatures lower than normal  —   prevails. Scientists are not surprised that some global temperatures are falling and expect that temperatures next year will be below those of the past two years because of La Niña. “But it’s still likely to be quite a bit warmer than average,” Mr. Halpert said. Scientists said the news media reports were also faulty in that they cited only temperatures over land, which account for about 30 percent of Earth’s surface. Temperatures over land are much more variable than those over water because land stores relatively little heat. “If you’re going to be making   assessments,” Dr. Arndt said, “you need to be looking at   data. ” Global data show a slower decline in temperatures than   data, scientists said. The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology posted about the Breitbart News report on Twitter on Thursday. The committee’s Republican chairman, Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, has accused the Obama administration of having a “suspect climate agenda. ” The House committee’s Twitter post drew sharp rebukes from scientists and others, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who wrote on Twitter referring to an academic expert cited in the article. The Mail on Sunday report, which was written by David Rose, was also strongly disputed online. One blogger headlined a post on the subject: “How Stupid Does David Rose Think You Are?”",0
