60077,How Ben Carson Could Undo a Desegregation Effort - The New York Times,"President Obama’s   legacy looked on track, not long ago, to include a major push against America’s deeply entrenched housing segregation. In 2015, his administration rolled out a rule requiring local communities to assess their own patterns of racial and income segregation and make genuine plans to address them. The move followed years of debate and came as segregated cities like Baltimore and Chicago faced renewed bouts of racial unrest. The federal government, advocates hoped, was finally trying to repair a   promise of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Now that rule is likely to be undermined  —   and possibly erased  —   by a Department of Housing and Urban Development headed by Ben Carson. On Monday,   Donald J. Trump officially offered the cabinet post to Mr. Carson, a neurosurgeon and a former presidential candidate, who grew up poor in Detroit but has no experience in housing policy. While we know little about what Mr. Carson would do at the agency, he has played down the role of government in his own     story. (“If you don’t succeed,” his mother taught him, according to his autobiography “Gifted Hands,” “you have only yourself to blame. ”) And he has specifically criticized the Obama housing rule. Known as “affirmatively furthering fair housing,” the rule has been politically contentious. Its backers argue that it is essential to remedying the long history of government and   discrimination that has resulted in poor, segregated neighborhoods persisting to this day. Critics say that the rule amounts to government overreach into the decisions  —   and demographic makeup  —   of individual communities and a free housing market. Republicans in Congress have tried to defund its implementation. Mr. Carson wrote last year that the new policy followed the government’s history of failed “mandated   schemes,” and would redirect   housing primarily into wealthy, white communities that oppose it. If he is confirmed by Congress, Mr. Carson would have wide latitude to shape or slow the rollout of the rule, along with broader enforcement of the Fair Housing Act. Diane Yentel, the president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said Mr. Carson’s interpretation of the rule as a social experiment “reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of obligations that have been around since 1968. ” The Fair Housing Act passed that year included two mandates: one banning discrimination in the housing market, and the other requiring local communities to “affirmatively further” the   goal of integration. The latter language means that it’s not enough to punish landlords or communities who intentionally deny minorities housing. Communities also have a responsibility to actively ensure open housing markets, which exist today neither in public housing clusters on Chicago’s segregated South Side nor in exclusive New York City suburbs that use zoning laws to outlaw multifamily housing. George Romney and Jack Kemp, past Republican HUD secretaries, acknowledged that second implication of the law. But for much of the time since the Fair Housing Act was passed, this “affirmative” mandate has been largely ignored by both local communities and HUD itself. The Obama administration rules were an effort to address that   oversight. And some   advocates have spent just as long fighting for it. Mr. Carson recently told Fox News that “we cannot have a strong nation if we have weak inner cities. ” “That is the very insight that motivated Senator Edward Brooke  —   another   Republican  —   to include a provision in the 1968 Fair Housing Act requiring cities, counties and states to ‘affirmatively further fair housing’ as a condition of receiving federal funding,” Michael Allen, a lawyer with the   law firm Relman, Dane  Colfax, wrote in an email. The Obama administration rule “looks nothing like the partisan caricatures that have sprung up around it,” said Phil Tegeler of the Poverty and Race Research Action Council. Many advocates wanted the rule to be much tougher than what emerged from several years of debate with local communities. In practice, the rule provides those communities with detailed data on factors like racial demographics, poverty rates, school quality and housing voucher use to help them determine whether   and minority families are isolated from good schools or segregated from opportunity. The rule requires communities to use that information to draft plans to reduce segregation where it exists. Those that habitually defy the requirements risk lose funding from the agency. The first round of communities scheduled to complete the process have been at work on assessments due over the coming year. Before they’re done, a new administration hostile to the idea could begin writing another rule that would reverse this one, or it could simply halt implementation. Or Congress could pass a law defunding it, even as it remains on the books. For all the years that went into shaping the rule, a new administration could relatively easily set it aside. That   would also fundamentally change the conversation in Washington about how poor, segregated communities came to exist in their current incarnation. Mr. Carson and other critics call efforts to dismantle them “social engineering,” but these places were created through policies that can themselves be labeled social engineering: redlining that denied blacks mortgages policies that concentrated public housing in poor, minority communities government decisions to locate highways that isolated them further. While many of these policies were first put into place decades ago, communities remain shaped by them today. The “affirmatively furthering” mandate was based on the idea that this history of active government intervention requires an active government remedy, too. A theme of Mr. Trump’s campaign was that structural forces hinder American workers in the Rust Belt and beyond (like the decline of manufacturing, the lack of educational opportunity, the opioid epidemic). At HUD, Mr. Carson would have ample opportunity to show whether he believes that structural forces undermine poor urban minorities (housing segregation, historic disinvestment, troubled schools)  —   and if government should take an active role in pursuing a remedy.",0
26115,ALARM TURNED OFF: Shocking Details on WHITE HOUSE Fence Jumper: “It was even worse than I thought”,"Secret Service personnel removed the alarm sensors along an area of fence line when the agency raised its height in response to previous fence-jumping incidents as a way to make it harder to scale. Ironically, the very effort to prevent fence jumping appears to have permitted a particularly egregious intrusion.One source said superiors in the Uniformed Division told Secret Service personnel to remove the sensors and piece them together for use elsewhere. They were never replaced.There are at least 10 to 12 officers and agents, including supervisors from the Presidential Protective Division, monitoring these sensors at any given time. They do so from the Joint Operations Command Center or JOCC, which is located outside of the White House complex.Some agents and officers also are questioning why Secret Service never released the K-9 unit to try to find an intruder after the alarms on the first fence the intruder scaled went off.Rep. Jason Chaffetz weighs in below on details of what the intruder did in those 17 minutes: The White House fence jumper who lingered on the ground unnoticed for 17 minutes was literally just hanging out in plain view with alarms blaring, and the Secret Service had no clue.Congressman Jason Chaffetz tells TMZ he met with the Director of Homeland Security and the Acting Director of the Secret Service for an hour and a half Tuesday, and his conclusion    It was even worse than I thought. Chaffetz says the surveillance video is shocking   the intruder was not darting around. Rather, he was  lingering,   hanging out  on the grounds. At one point he took the time to bend down and tie his shoes.The intruder at times peered through windows of the building, where Trump was inside. As we previously reported, he also jiggled a doorknob.Chaffetz says some of the alarms failed but some went off, yet the intruder was not detected.Secret Service agents did check the grounds, but not with any urgency. Alarms frequently go off for various reasons, and this time it was met with an inadequate response.And Chaffetz says the video shows agents were simply  lackadaisical.  As he put it,  Everything went wrong.  The congressman says he was promised there would be  big changes,  adding,  There better be. Via: tmz",1
65406,Jews ‘blamed for Holocaust’ at House of Lords event,"Jews ‘blamed for Holocaust’ at House of Lords event Jews ‘blamed for Holocaust’ at House of Lords event By 0 60 
Israel has condemned a “shameful” event hosted by the British House of Lords in which Jews were blamed for the Holocaust and Israel was compared to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL). 
The session marked the launch of the Balfour Apology Campaign ahead of the Balfour Declaration centenary. The 1917 declaration pledged British support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. 
A spokesperson for the Israeli embassy said the gathering “gave voice to racist tropes against Jews and Israelis alike.” 
According to the Times, an audience member was applauded after suggesting Hitler only decided to kill Jews after being provoked by anti-German protests led by a rabbi, Stephen Wise, in New York. 
“[He] made the boycott on Germany, the economic boycott… which antagonized Hitler, over the edge, to then want to systematically kill Jews wherever he could find them.”

The speaker also said Rabbi Wise told the New York Times in 1905 there were “6 million bleeding and suffering reasons to justify Zionism.” This quote is often used by Holocaust deniers to suggest the figure of 6 million Jews later killed by the Nazis was a myth. 
The audience member – reportedly a member of the anti-Zionist strictly Orthodox Neturei Karta sect – also compared Israel to IS. 
“Just as the so-called Jewish state in Palestine doesn’t come from Judaism. This Islamic State in Syria is nothing with Islam. It is a perversion of Islam just as Zionism is a perversion of Judaism.” 
Another audience member said, to applause: “If anybody is anti-Semitic, it’s Israelis themselves.” 
David Collier, a blogger who attended the session, says he “witnessed a Jew-hating festival at the heart of the British estate.” 
The event run by Baroness Tonge, a former Liberal Democrat MP who sits as an independent, and the Palestinian Return Centre. 
Tonge reportedly made no attempt to challenge the comments. 
She has run into trouble for her own anti-Israeli outbursts and resigned as the Lib Dem whip after claiming the state of Israel was “not going to be there forever.” 
The House of Lords event was also run by the Palestinian Return Centre. 
Campaigners are calling on Britain to apologize for the Balfour Declaration and show remorse for its “past colonial crimes” in Palestine.

23340, Donald Trump Is Even Making Enemies Of The Koch Brothers; Here’s Why,"Since Citizens United, and even before, two names have been consistent Republican stalwarts and Republican donors. Before Donald Trump, it was apparent that the Republican party was owned by the Koch brothers and Walmart, both of whom are ardent supporters of free trade and cheap labor. Now, Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan are making enemies of both, and the Republican party is in turmoil.In June, before Trump was even elected, Republicans began their war on imports by sketching a  blueprint  for tax reform that would make imports a lot more expensive, and these days, pretty much everything you and I buy is an import.Trump didn t love Congress  original plan, but his plan would add a 20 percent import tax to imports from Mexico. The Kochs and Walmart aren t happy about that.The GOP confusion is mirrored by a scrambling of alliances on K Streets that hasn t been seen in living memory.  Trump more than any president I ve seen has created a little bit of chaos within some client rosters. He s not afraid to pit people against each other,  said one lobbyist who has clients that may wind up on both sides of the issue. When that happens, lobby shops will have to pick which side they re on. But as long as it s just a vague concept, that reckoning can wait.  Theres no legislative text. We don t have a conflict until we have a bill,  he said.Corporate America has had plenty of intramural matches over the years. But rewriting the tax code is a dozen Super Bowls played all on the same day. Manufacturers, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell and pharmaceutical companies, have quickly organized to praise the border tax. Retailers, including Walmart, Target and Kohl s, are trying to kill it. They re joined by right-wing megadonors Charles and David Koch. In December, Koch Industries   which imports crude and tar sands oil to be refined in the United States   said the House GOP plan would  adversely impact American consumers by forcing them to pay higher prices on products   they use every single day.  Prices at the pump, they have warned, would skyrocket, and nothing gets a member of Congress  attention faster than the flipping numbers at an Exxon station.Source: Huffington PostThis puts Congress in a tough spot, and as liberals, we should be grabbing the popcorn. The Kochs and the Waltons (Walmart heirs) are huge GOP donors and in return, they expect that wages will be kept low (Republicans are still happy to accommodate), regulations will be kept to a minimum (again, Republicans are on board) and imports will be kept cheap.While this infighting is great for us and ultimately, for the country (the Republican party will be hurting without their cash, which will increase our chances of regaining Congress and state houses in 2018), it does put us in a weird position. Defending the Kochs and Walmart is pretty much against everything we stand for, but they also have their fingers on the pulse of red state America. As Americans start paying a premium for their Bounty paper towels and Walmart crap, people will start to revolt, and thanks to the Kochs and the Waltons, they ll know who to revolt against.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",1
21336,Trump Prepares For Mass Deportations: “2 To 3 Million Undocumented Immigrants With Criminal Records… They’re Going To Be Gone”,"
If you are an illegal immigrant in America with a criminal record your days are numbered, according to President-elect Donald Trump.
Following up on his campaign promise to build a security wall on the southern border and deport any undocumented immigrants with criminal records immediately upon taking office, Trump sat down with 60 Minutes on Sunday to reiterate his plans.
President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to deport two to three million undocumented immigrants with criminal records from the country immediately – and has insisted that he will build his wall.
In his first extensive interview since he won the White House, Trump is reassuring his supporters that he will deport or incarcerate up to three million ‘gang members’ and ‘drug dealers.’ 
…
‘What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,’ Trump said.
‘But we’re getting them out of our country, they’re here illegally.’
As the Commander-In-Chief Trump will have the power to enforce existing immigration laws, which among other things call for the deportation of individuals entering the country illegally. Under the Obama administration millions of immigrants were allowed to enter the country without recourse and Border Patrol agents from Texas to California were told to stand down and do nothing.
Trump and others have said that undocumented workers pose a direct threat to the national security of the United States because with current immigration policies, which require no documentation whatsoever, it is impossible to know who is entering our country and from which country they originate. It’s been reported that numerous individuals with ties to terrorism have been apprehended on the border , and that potentially scores of others have already been smuggled into the United States by Mexican drug cartels.
Though the President-Elect has promised to either deport or incarcerate millions of illegal immigrants with criminal records, he stopped short of claiming that all undocumented immigrants living in the United States would be deported:
‘After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we’re going to make a determination on the people that they’re talking about who are terrific people, they’re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that ,’ Trump said.
‘But before we make that determination…it’s very important, we are going to secure our border.’
Watch Trump make his promise to deport criminals in a September 1, 2016 Immigration Speech:
Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone. You can call it ‘deported’ if you want… the press doesn’t like that term… you can call it whatever you want… they’re gone. 
Their days have run out in this country… the crime will stop… they’re going to be gone. It will be over. 

If you think Anti-Trump protestors have gone off the rails following Hillary’s loss, just wait until Trump starts nationwide mass deportations. 
We encourage you to consider the implications of this policy and prepare for widespread violence now , because this could quickly escalate to open warfare on the street of America.

68820,‘STRANGER THINGS’ – Hollywood MK Ultra Goes Full Occult,"Jay Dyer 21st Century WireThe popular 80s pastiche series Stranger Things begins with a familiar scene of E.T. nostalgia, centering around Dungeons & Dragons. The scene is particularly familiar to me, since I played D&D back in the day, but learned very quickly this nefarious practice was like kryptonite to all things female.  Oddly enough, the series appears to reflect a new trend amongst Hollywood A-listers, where nerd culture has revived the ancient 80s practice of playing D&D.  The Hollywood Reporter explains the trend and its connection to acting and role-playing: Vin Diesel plays it. So do Dwayne Johnson, Drew Barrymore, Stephen Colbert, Mike Myers and Jon Favreau, among other bold-face names. Some even built their careers by playing it The decades-old role-playing game   in which participants roll multisided dice while pretending to be mystical creatures such as elves and dwarves   finally is coming out of the closet (or, in this case, Mom s basement).  There s a huge resurgence of nerd culture, especially with the tech boom,  says Silicon Valley s Martin Starr, a longtime D&D enthusiast.  If nerds were still poor and living at their mothers , nobody would be paying any attention to Dungeons & Dragons. But nerds rule the world, and D&D is making a big comeback   and I m excited about it. While this certainly relates to a furtherance of one s improv skills, it also relates to the occult side of Hollywood, though I don t take the ridiculous evangelical view that D&D is inherently evil.  Rather, the notion of role-playing is synonymous with the ancient view of acting as dramaturgy, or ritual invocation of the gods.  Comparative religion scholar Dudley Young writes: The earliest gods were invoked by ritual act (dromenon = the thing done) such as a sacrificial dance, commemorating the fact that our life begins and ends when they call upon us.  Subsequently the thing was said (legomenon) as well as done, and the dromenon was on its way to becoming the drama.  Once speech within the temple precincts has been endowed with the power of word-magic, we have  the invocation  properly so called.  (Dudley Young, Origins of the Sacred: The Ecstasies of Love and War, pg. 413)Set in the fictional small town of Hawkins, Indiana in 1983, we will see the accidental dramaturgical invocation where the D&D simulacrum appears to actually be related on a deeper level to the occult phenomena that begin to occur.  The disappearance of young Will Byers sparks a series of events that take Hawkins down a black rabbit hole of every conspiracy theory ever, melded with the opening of the inter-dimensional gates from every John Carpenter film. Originally slated to be titled  Montauk,  the series echoes the dubious accounts of Project Montauk, where purportedly time and space were altered in government-sponsored PsyOps and time travel  experiments with famed UFO researcher Jacques Vallee commenting the experiments were related to the Philadelphia Experiment.  For more information and speculation on this topic, I interviewed Dr. Farrell on his views here.D & D invokes the entities in E.T.. The stories of Montauk appear to originate in a book series by Preston Nichols, who claims to have discovered  repressed memories  of the event.  This laughable scenario immediately smacks of PsyOps, making the original connection to large-scale deception all the more appropriate.  Even Vallee alleges the  experiment is a hoax, suggesting an experiment in seeing what you can get people to believe, as opposed to some real space-time warping experiment. Vallee writes: I hypothesized that the experiments had to do with a radar countermeasures test. Indeed a Raytheon advertisement published thirteen years ago suggested that the corresponding technology was now out in the open (Raytheon, 1980). This hypothesis, however, failed to explain a few of the facts that highlighted the story. In particular it did not account for the observed disappearance of the destroyer from the harbor, for the mysterious devices brought on board under extreme security precautions, or for the alleged disappearance of two sailors from a nearby tavern. While it may be the case that the Navy altered space-time, does Vallee not consider the possibility this is all bullshit, as so many  military whistleblowers  and  generals  so often  leak ?  Rather, as is so often the case, all the  evidence  for these events relies on some retired Navy man with all the credentials of the Navy man from the Village People. This is also why the Montauk tale mixes aliens and other nonsense in with the notion of the Apollo Mission being staged   disinformation.  Vallee himself was a high up government operator with an interest in occultism and Rosicrucianism, and is represented in Spielberg s Close Encounters by the character of Claude Lacombe (played by Francois Truffaut).Through the dimensional gate: the Demogorgon saps energy and hatches incubus style demon-babies in Ridley Scott form. .Thus, all of this functions as the spirit behind Stranger Things, as well as myriad other influences, such as Star Wars, Alien, Goonies, H.P. Lovecraft, Evil Dead, X-Men, Stephen King, and John Carpenter.  That said, I consider the series as accurately showing some aspects of the spiritual realm, couched in scientistic mysticism, where our initial suspicion of extra-terrestrial alien manipulation is revealed to be both terrestrial and demonic.  The Demogorgon inhabits a realm that is the  upside down,  the negative or demonic dark side of our world, which matches up to the Kabbalistic notion of the Qilphoth or the Abyss of Da at at times, as Crowley claims: This doctrine is extremely difficult to explain; but it corresponds more or less to the gap in thought between the Real, which is ideal, and the Unreal, which is actual. In the Abyss all things exist, indeed, at least in posse, but are without any possible meaning; for they lack the substratum of spiritual Reality. They are appearances without Law. They are thus Insane Delusions  Now the Abyss being thus the great storehouse of Phenomena, it is the source of all impressions. Spoiler alert, but the missing children are not only part of MK Ultra, but are being used in top-secret testing that includes LSD, sensory deprivation and the development of Men Who Stare at Goats (or Kids Who Stare at Kittens)-type mental powers.  Interestingly, the abducted super-soldier kid named  11  and  El  is specifically told to kill a kitten which is rumored to be an aspect of trauma-based mind control.  Basically, all the rumors of hardcore child abuse and mind control are rolled into the series with the character  El,  who is able to remote view the spiritual realm and spy on Soviets (as well as Demogorgons).Like the simulacrum in Spielberg films, the spirits communicate across the void through the Kabbalistic principle of esoteric symbology and linguistics, as I showed in my Close Encounters analysis.. Oblivious to the dangers of such programs, Mr. Man in Black Shadow Government from the Dept. of Energy persists in hunting down his escaped  daughter  El (hinting at sexual abuse), who finds her way into the Goonies gang of Mike, Will and Lucas (I m assuming you ve seen it).  Most interesting is the biblical and occult notion of the opening of  gates  through such  scientific  experiments, which are in fact occult rituals involving child adduction and sacrifice under the guise of  cancer  research (MK Ultra).  Could this be a hint at what the cancer complex is really involved in?  Genetic and psychological experimentation with children for the  greater good ?  Certainly there have been numerous cases of missing children in the US, as well as small towns experimented on by the shadow government.  It would seem that Stanger Things is obliquely referencing these themes, as well as the possibility of actual murders and abductions, as author William Ramsey argues here.Given blood and sacrifice bring the demon and open the gate, we can assume the references are to the goetia, where demons are invoked through sigils. . Two notions that occurred to me I have not seen tacked yet in the series is the strange reference to the loss of  father  and  God,  as we see no strong male figures.  Hop the cop, like a horny rabbit, hops from girl to girl having lost his daughter, while Will s father is a deadbeat.  In Mike and Nancy s household, the ineffectual, sterile father character of Mr. Wheeler remains ever clueless while arguing to Mrs. Wheeler the  government is on our side,  and would never lie.Set in the Cold War, the fear and panic of the ridiculous  Russian Threat  in the background of the series allows the shadow state to develop the explicitly-named Star Wars Defense Program, where  lasers and space weapons  are being made to destroy the  Russkies.  Amazingly accurate in this insight, this is a point JaysAnalysis has been highlighting the last few years with the hype of the Cold War deception allowing for the rise of the dark military industrial complex which seems to have a penchant for human sacrifice.  Note that I have argued many times that Mk Ultra was not merely a mind control experiment, but was about the entire biosphere, under the Department of Energy.Cop Hop discovers the advanced weapons lab facility is involved in MK Ultra   something I have discussed many times. . The sacrifice of the youth for the dark designs of the shadow government is the ultimate conspiracy in the series, but what is more remarkable than this is the explanation by the Man in Black Dr. Brenner (Matthew Modine) that the sacrifice of sons and daughters for the gorgodemon is for the good of America.  In other words, we are given the impression our villain knows the real source of the dark power in Hawkins, the demonic, and that the sacrifice of humans and blood draws it nearer and nearer.  Foolishly assuming this dark energy can be harnessed for U.S. supremacy, Dr. Brenner is behind both MK Ultra and the SDI program that requires the sacrifice of America s  sons and daughters !  This spiritual dimension is the accurate and insightful aspect of the series, but the message is not all good.Dr. Brenner demands more demonic channeling from El. Note her similarity of appearance to the Princess in The Never Ending Story..  The flip side, as mentioned, is that El as an androgynous, yet dominantly feminine archetype, is a form of the incarnation of the goddess.  We have seen this of late in pop fiction more times than I can count, in examples like Hanna, Hunger Games, Lucy, Ex Machina and Jupiter Ascending, where the gnostic perspective of exalting the opposing force to the male is assumed to bring a cosmically needed  balance to the war hawk patriarchy.  A perennial myth of liberal fantasies, the feminist archetype will in no way bring peace and balance, only more destruction as gender roles continue to be confused.  Feminism is part of that very destruction, and the fact that El shouts out in the aether  God,   Dad  and  Gone,  suggests her association with Dr. Brenner as her  dad  and Father God s lack of answer to her call, means the solution to the spiritual problems of man can be found in a Luciferian evolution of humans beyond the  traps  of gender and evil patriarchal deities.  In occultist Edmund Spenser s Faerie Queen, we read:Downe in the bottome of the deepe Abysse Where Demogorgon in dull darknesse pent, Farre from the view of Gods and heauens blis, The hideous Chaos keepes, their dreadfull dwelling is.   (Book IV, Canto ii, stanza 47)In the process of becoming cruciform, the sacred feminine pistis Sophia incarnate destroys the patriarchal  non-God. .  Indeed, El annihilates the cruciform Demogorgon as if it were a demiurge that has imprisoned the town spiritually.  This is precisely the Luciferian view   Jesus and/or God the Father are demiurges who have imprisoned humans in this dimension and sap their energy as vampires, requiring blood sacrifice.  Of course, none of that is true, as the Logos is the salvation of the human race, reconciling them to God by becoming Incarnate and destroying Death.  In the gnostic scheme the roles are reversed, where El becomes the Luciferian dark hero rescuing the town through her sacrifice to destroy the cruciform demon-god.  And, as you probably guessed, that is why her name is  El,  recalling the old Canaanite term for the gods who warred against Jehovah in the Bible.  In fact, the Demogorgon is generally traced back to the demiurge.The series also uses numerology frequently, such as  11  and  77  suggesting the demonology of Crowley and references to 9/11 as a ritual initiation.  Interestingly, light is mentioned several times in the series as both a means of communication and symbol of enlightenment.  As you can see in the above image,  photosynthesis  is placed behind El as she dissolves the Demogorgon, suggesting the dissolution of Traditional Religion by  enlightenment,  perfectly consonant with the message of Gnosticism and Luciferianism.The gateways have been opened through mass human sacrifice of America s sons and daughters   the  new man  is a dark, half-androgynous goddess who will destroy the  genocidal  patriarchal religions and bring a new Amerikan aeon of the crowned and conquering girl-child, a Luciferian world order.READ MORE HOLLYWOOD NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Hollywood FilesTo hear Jay s full podcasts, see more information and learn how you can become a subscriber to JaysAnalysis.Jay Dyer is the author of the forthcoming title, Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film from Trine Day.

18566, The Amazon Reviews Of The Trump Christmas Ornament Are The Best Thing About The Election,"2016 has been a gawdawful year. We lost David Bowie, Prince, Gene Wilder, Elie Wiesel and more than I d care to mention. We re also losing perhaps the best president in any of our lifetimes, although hopefully he ll be on this earth for a long while to come. One of the most lasting legacies of 2016 will be the fact that Donald Trump prevailed and we are now facing a white supremacist (or at least someone who won t denounce white supremacy) as our next president.We can take small solace in the fact that the vast majority of Americans did not vote for Trump. Only 25 percent did. He lost the popular vote by a significant margin but because of the antiquated voter suppression tool called the Electoral College, Trump won.For those who voted for Trump, and those who didn t, there is one prevailing image, and that was Trump s  Make America Great Again  red trucker cap. In case you haven t seen enough of that cap, you can order a Christmas ornament of it from Amazon.com for the low, low price of just $209.99 (plus free shipping). The cap is made of brass, and like everything Trump, it s finished in 14 karat gold. Or is it 24 karat? The Amazon page doesn t seem to be sure.While I have no idea how many people actually bought this overpriced Christmas ornament, the Amazon comments were, as usual, the best part.Here are just a few:Even the sellers aren t fans of the Great Orange One. Here s how they re answering some of the questions: Well, the nation is in grief. The best thing we can do (outside of crossing all 10 fingers and all 10 toes that Jill Stein s recount will work) is choose to laugh instead of cry. That s what the people on Amazon are doing, anyway.Buy one, while it s still available.Featured image via eBay",1
56581,Don’t underestimate Rand Paul as a 2016 presidential contender,"The first nine months of 2013 have convinced us of one thing: Rand Paul acts, and the rest of the potential 2016 Republican presidential field reacts.

On drones, the senator from Kentucky led a 13-hour filibuster that drew Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), among others, to the floor in support. On Syria, Paul was out front in his opposition to a military strike — a position that more than two dozen of his Republican Senate colleagues came to share.

Paul, in short, seems to be a step or two in front of the ongoing transformation of the Republican Party from a hawkish conservatism to a sort of populist libertarianism.

That’s not to say, of course, that significant strains of resistance to the vision of the Republican Party that Paul is offering don’t remain. They do. And it remains to be seen whether the establishment, such as it is — elected officials and major donors, primarily — can unite to keep Paul from the nomination in favor of a politically “safer” choice such as Rubio or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

And Paul, as he showed with his civil rights comments during his 2010 Senate campaign in Kentucky, holds some controversial views that can — and will — get him into trouble in the glare of the national spotlight.

But anyone who laughs at Paul as a serious contender, dismisses him as just a carbon copy of his father — former representative Ron Paul (R-Tex.) — or otherwise writes him off would do well to study the year in politics so far. No one in the GOP has had a better year than Paul. And it’s not all that close.

Below are our rankings of the 10 candidates with the best chance of winding up as the Republican presidential nominee. While this should go without saying, making predictions in 2013 about 2016 is something short of purely scientific.

10. Mike Pence: The Indiana governor is flying way under the radar at the moment, but he has the makings of a potential 2016 dark horse. Social and fiscal conservatives like him, he’s a charismatic communicator and, perhaps most important, he doesn’t work in Washington.

John Kasich: The Ohio governor’s poll numbers have recovered remarkably well from his first few years in office, and he now looks like a modest favorite for reelection against much-touted Democratic nominee Ed FitzGerald. If Kasich wins in 2014, he has a case to make as a swing-state Midwestern governor who previously served as the chairman of the House Budget Committee and who ran, albeit briefly, for president in 2000.

8. Bobby Jindal: We believe that Jindal’s stock was probably a bit too high a year ago and is now a bit too low. His numbers in Louisiana still aren’t great, but they are better than earlier this year. Jindal’s decision to reject Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act will be a feather in his cap among conservative presidential-primary voters.

7. Scott Walker : The Wisconsin governor may have a bit more of a reelection race on his hands than he originally thought with wealthy former Trek executive Mary Burke running for the Democratic nomination. And we hear from reliable Wisconsin sources that Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is more interested in running than we believed. If Ryan runs, it’s hard to see Walker also getting in.

6. Ted Cruz : Cruz is the biggest attraction among rank-and-file Republicans at the moment. He evokes genuine passion among the base — and that’s not ever to be underestimated. But it’s also worth remembering that Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) held that title once upon a time, and she held it much closer to the time when people were actually set to cast votes for president.

5. Jeb Bush: This is our holding-pattern ranking for the former Florida governor. If he announces that he’s running or even that he’s moving toward running — heck, we’d take a Bush trip to Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina — then he is probably our No. 1 on the list.

4. Paul Ryan: See the note above about our previous underestimating of Ryan’s interest in running. The coming fights over the government shutdown and raising the debt ceiling are ready-made for Ryan and will (re)increase his profile nationally. We still are skeptical that he has the political chops to run a two-year-plus campaign for the Republican nomination, though.

3. Marco Rubio: Rubio’s front-runner status has clearly come into question in the aftermath of his work to pass comprehensive immigration reform through the Senate. The bill’s fate remains decidedly uncertain in the GOP-controlled House and is still not popular among the party’s grass roots. For those who write off Rubio because of immigration, however, go back and watch his speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention. He is someone of considerable political talent.

2. Chris Christie: Yes, Christie has something of a base problem given the false idea that he somehow cost Mitt Romney the 2012 election because of his embrace of President Obama after Hurricane Sandy. But Christie’s regular-guy populism is a nice fit for the times.

1. Rand Paul: He’s not a clear front-runner. But, if you are looking for a candidate who can (a) raise the money, (b) has a clear and compelling message and (c) has an obvious edge in an early state (Iowa), then Paul is the only person in the top three who checks all three boxes. We repeat what we said above: Underestimate him at your peril.",0
42993,Exclusive: Australia-U.S. refugee swap again in doubt as officials exit Nauru,"SYDNEY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials interviewing refugees held in an Australian-run offshore detention center left the facility abruptly, three detainees told Reuters on Saturday, throwing further doubt over a plan to resettle many of the detainees in America.  U.S. officials halted screening interviews and departed the Pacific island of Nauru on Friday, two weeks short of their scheduled timetable and a day after Washington said the United States had reached its annual refugee intake cap.  “U.S. (officials) were scheduled to be on Nauru until July 26 but they left on Friday,” one refugee told Reuters, requesting anonymity as he did not want to jeopardize his application for U.S. resettlement.  In the United States, a senior member of the union that represents refugee officers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a Department of Homeland Security agency, told Reuters his own trip to Nauru was not going forward as scheduled.  Jason Marks, chief steward of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1924, told Reuters his trip has now been pushed back and it was unclear whether it will actually happen. The USCIS said on Saturday that the program would continue but offered no details.  “We do not discuss the exact dates of USCIS’ circuit rides to adjudicate refugees’ applications. However, we are planning return trips,” the agency said in a statement.   “It is not uncommon for the dates of tentatively planned refugee circuit ride trips worldwide to change due to a wide variety of factors.” The Australian Immigration Department declined to comment on the whereabouts of the U.S. officials or the future of a refugee swap agreement between Australia and the United States that President Donald Trump earlier this year branded a “dumb deal”. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said on Sunday the deal was progressing as expected, reiterating the government had assurances from the Trump administration. “The quota will roll over again on October 1 as I said, and I expect that the United States will adhere to this agreement, as the president promised,” she told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.  An indefinite postponement of the deal would have significant repercussions for Australia’s pledge to close a second detention center on Papua New Guinea’s Manus island on Oct 31. Only 70 refugees, less than 10 percent of the total detainees held in the camp, have completed U.S. processing. Bishop said she did not believe it was the case only 10 percent of refugees had been processed. “The U.S. deal looks more and more doubtful,” Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said. “The U.S. deal was never the solution the Australian government pretended it to be.” Former U.S. President Barack Obama agreed a deal with Australia late last year to offer refuge to up to 1,250 asylum seekers, a deal the Trump administration said it would only honor to maintain a strong relationship with Australia and then only on condition that refugees satisfied strict checks. In exchange, Australia has pledged to take Central American refugees from a center in Costa Rica, where the United States has taken in a larger number of people in recent years. The swap is designed, in part, to help Australia close both Manus and Nauru, which are expensive to run and have been widely criticized by the United Nations and others over treatment of detainees. The U.S. government confirmed on Thursday that its refugee intake cap of 50,000 people had been reached with the new intake year not due to begin until Oct. 1. Exemptions could be made for those who have a “credible claim to a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,” following a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court last month reviving elements of Trump’s travel ban while it considers the legality of the order. Given the risky boat journey the refugees in Manus and Nauru undertook to reach Australia, it is unlikely many of them have strong family ties to the United States, experts said. The majority of the detainees interviewed on both Manus and Nauru by U.S. officials in April are from Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan. Australia’s hardline immigration policy requires asylum seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia to be sent for processing to camps at Manus and on Nauru. They are told they will never be settled in Australia. Trump’s resistance to the refugee deal had strained relations with a key Asia Pacific ally, triggering a fractious phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull earlier this year. Trump’s concession and a series of high-level visits by U.S. dignities have since help mend connections between the two countries.  Australia has already offered detainees up to $25,000 to voluntarily return to their home countries, an offer few have taken up. ",0
27669, Ben Carson Praises Time Trump Compared Him To Child Molester: ‘You Have To Admit’ It Worked (VIDEO),"The only thing sadder than losing a Republican presidential race to a reality tv show host is then having to grovel at the feet of said reality tv show host and beg for scraps. And in 2016 there is no sadder sad sack than Ben Carson. The one time presidential front runner has spent the past few weeks shamelessly stumping for a guy who once couldn t wait to spread vicious rumors about him. And all for the off-chance that Trump won t forget about him once he becomes emperor president.But wait, what about Chris Christie? Surely, the New Jersey Governor who has had to grin and bear it while Trump mocks him to his face while standing next to him at political rallies has had it worse! Sadly, not. Because as low as Christie s self-esteem gets   and it s gotten very low   there is something singularly depressing about the position Carson is in. After all, when you find yourself defending Donald Trump s comparison of you to a child molester, you ve dug a hole for yourself so deep that you re on your way to China.Alas, here s Carson doing just that.In an interview with Yahoo News, Carson was reminded of the time that Trump, in an egotistical rage, decided to link Carson to that of a child molester. But not before labeling Carson a  pathological liar  first. When he says he s pathological   and he says that in the book, I don t say that   and again, I m not saying anything, I m not saying anything other than pathological is a very serious disease. And he said he s pathological, somebody said he has pathological disease. That s a big problem because you don t cure that  as an example: child molesting. You don t cure these people. You don t cure a child molester. There s no cure for it. Pathological, there s no cure for that. Was Trump calling Carson a child molester? Of course not! He was merely saying Carson s  pathology  was of the same level as that of one. To which Carson responded on Wednesday: You have to admit to a degree [Trump comparing me to a child molester] did work. Adding: A lot of people believed him. Well said, Mr. Carson. Clearly you are a man of such integrity that you won t even defend yourself when a dumpster fire with a hair piece accuses you of being of the same mental health as a child predator. Gifted hands. No spine.Carson s endorsement of Trump has always seemed particularly vile because he had previously spent his entire campaign focused almost entirely on pretending to care about the  angry rhetoric  in the race. Repeatedly, he called for candidates to tone down the mudslinging (to no effect.) His  I quit  speech explicitly lamented the toxic state of the race. Here s how he described his ideal candidate:Carson stated that in choosing the next person to lead America, you d  need someone who has demonstrated significant accomplishment  whose ideas and policies are clear,  and whose character would be revealed by  how they treat others and their family.  We d also  need to see what they have done for America. And then he picked the exact opposite, Donald J. Trump.Featured image via Yahoo News",1

Jerry Brown signs bill allowing felons to vote from their jail cells pic.twitter.com/6bhKD4hOZJ  FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) September 29, 2016Despite widespread opposition from law enforcement, Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday signed a bill that will allow thousands of felons in county jails to vote in California elections as part of an effort to speed their transition back into society.Through a representative, Brown declined to comment on the bill by Assemblywoman Shirley Weber (D-San Diego), who said it would reduce the likelihood of convicts committing new crimes. Civic participation can be a critical component of re-entry and has been linked to reduced recidivism,  Weber said when the bill was introduced.On Wednesday, Weber said California is setting an example at a time when other state s are trying to limit voting rights. I wrote AB 2466 because I want to send a message to the nation that California will not stand for discrimination in voting,  Weber said Wednesday after the bill was signed.Sen. Patricia Bates (R-Laguna Niguel) criticized the approval of the legislation, which takes effect Jan. 1.Bates said the new law will undermine the integrity of elections by allowing people in jail to decide close contest.

53370,В ответ на западные санкции русские перестали умирать,"0 комментариев 3 поделились Фото: архив Pravda. Ru 
За январь-август 2016 года умерли около 1,27 миллиона человек. ""Это на 21,8 тысячи человек или на 1,7% меньше, чем за соответствующий период 2015 года"", — отметил глава Минтруда. Снижение числа умерших зарегистрировано в 73 регионах. В ряде регионов, включая Республику Алтай, Забайкальский край, Костромскую область, Севастополь, темпы снижения числа умерших составили более 5%. 
С чем связаны такие положительные цифры, Pravda. Ru рассказал ведущий научный сотрудник международной лаборатории политической демографии и макросоциологической динамики ВШЭ, демограф Андрей Коротаев. 
""Главный фактор естественного прироста в эти годы, в эти месяцы этого года, не столько рост рождаемости (он не очень большой), сколько заметное снижение смертности в первые семь месяцев"", — отметил эксперт. Связано это с внедрением — Единой государственной автоматизированной информационной системы (ЕГАИС), которая обеспечила эффективный контроль над продажами алкоголя и резко снизила количество продаваемого нелегального. 
Андрей Коротаев добавил, что в нашей стране официальные продажи выросли, но реальное употребление алкоголя сократилось, потому что алкоголь стал менее доступен. Легальный алкоголь дороже нелегального. Поэтому главный фактор снижения смертности в стране и вообще любого колебания этого показателя принято связывать с алкогольным фактором. ""Благодарим Росалкогольрегулирование"", — объяснил собеседник Pravda. Ru. 
Что касается рождаемости, по мнению демографа, с ней в ближайшее время появятся серьезные проблемы. Всему причина — замораживание материнского капитала — мера абсолютна несвоевременная. Но на данном этапе рождаемость все же растет, на нее влияет региональная политика. В Хабаровске, например, при рождении третьего ребенка полностью погашается размер ипотеки. 
Эксперт Pravda. Ru рассказал, что весь этот позитивный эффект краткосрочен. Стоит готовиться к падению рождаемости и росту смертности. ""ЕГАИС добились заметного снижения смертности, но сейчас, на фоне замораживания акцизов, разговоров про то, чтобы понижать минимальную цену на водку, боюсь, что у нас и смертность начнет расти уже в ближайшее время"", — спрогнозировал демограф Андрей Коротаев.

7832,Critics decry Trump plan to limit counter-extremism program,"SAN FRANCISCO/ WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Trump administration effort to exclude violent white supremacists from a government anti-terrorism program and focus efforts solely on Islamist extremism drew a sharp backlash Thursday, with New York state’s top prosecutor denouncing the move and civil liberties advocates suggesting it is illegal. The proposed revamp, reported by Reuters on Wednesday, would rename the multi-agency “Countering Violent Extremism” (CVE) task force to “Countering Islamic Extremism” or “Countering Radical Islamic Extremism,” and eliminate initiatives aimed at other violent hate groups in the United States. “Abandoning efforts to counter violent white supremacist ideology is profoundly misguided and will endanger Americans,”     New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement, adding that he urged President Donald Trump to keep the focus on  “all extremist threats.” Hugh Handeyside, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said an explicit focus on American Muslims would violate “basic constitutional principles,” suggesting the changes described would be met with legal challenges. The Anti-Defamation League also criticized the plan, citing internal research that found 74 percent of deaths caused by domestic extremists between 2007 and 2016 were caused by “right-wing extremists such as white supremacists, sovereign citizens and militia adherents.” Postings on white supremacist websites welcomed the potential changes.  Facebook Inc., which like many internet platforms is often used by extremists, has financially supported at least one  CVE initiative but had no comment Thursday on the prospective changes. Sharp rhetoric about the threat posed by “radical Islam” was a central part of Trump’s 2016 election campaign. The Republican frequently ridiculed then President Barack Obama and Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for being politically correct in their approach to groups such as Islamic State. Contributors to Stormfront, a white supremacist web site, praised the administration.     “Oh my goodness. Is this for real. Amazing my government no longer targets me as the enemy,” wrote one prolific poster going by the username Magog.     Another regular poster, Celtchar, wrote: “Wow. It just keeps getting better and better,” adding that the anti-fascist movement’s “days are numbered.” The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) declined to comment on the proposed changes. Last Friday, Trump signed an executive order temporarily blocking travel to the United States by people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, prompting a global outcry and charges from his critics that he was advancing a white nationalist agenda. Trump has said he wants to put America first but has rejected characterizations of the order as a “Muslim ban.” Trump’s moves have already undermined participation in the CVE program, which is based on working with community groups to identify potential “lone wolf” attackers and recruits. Minnesota-based Ka Joog, a nonprofit which provides community based programs for Somali youth, late Wednesday became the second group to pull out of the program, citing concerns about the Trump administration’s posture toward Muslims in turning down a $499,998 grant. “That’s a lot of money, especially in the nonprofit world,” said Mohamed Farah, the organization’s director. “But at the end of the day it all comes down to principle. I am a refugee, I am a Muslim, I am an immigrant and this president is against everything I stand for.”     Last week, Leaders Advancing & Helping Communities, a Michigan-based group led by Lebanese-Americans and another grant recipient, declined a $500,000 provided by the DHS.

68654,Haiti and Africa Projects Shed Light on Clinton’s Public-Private Web - The New York Times,"As chief of staff and counselor to Hillary Clinton at the State Department, Cheryl D. Mills worked ceaselessly to help a South Korean garment maker open a factory in Haiti, the centerpiece of United States government efforts to   the island nation’s economy after the 2010 earthquake. Ms. Mills took the lead on smoothing the way for the company,   Trading, which secured millions of dollars in incentives to make its Haiti investment more attractive, despite criticism of its labor record elsewhere. When she presided over the project’s unveiling in September 2010, she introduced  ’s chairman,   Kim, as the most important person at the ceremony, which included Mrs. Clinton and the Haitian prime minister. Mr. Kim would later become important to Ms. Mills in a far more personal way  —   as a financial backer of a company she started after leaving the State Department in 2013. The company, BlackIvy Group, is pursuing infrastructure projects in Tanzania and Ghana, the only African nations in the “Partnership for Growth,” an Obama administration initiative that Mrs. Clinton helped introduce that promotes investment in developing countries. The partnership with Mr. Kim sheds light on the business activities of Ms. Mills  —   a longtime Clinton loyalist who is likely to play a significant role in any future Clinton White House  —   as well as the interlocking public and private relationships that have long characterized the Clintons’ inner circle. A lawyer, Ms. Mills has been a target of Republican critics for her central role in determining which emails from Mrs. Clinton’s private server would be publicly disclosed, and for sharing information about Africa  —   later designated as classified  —   with the Clinton Foundation while working at the State Department. During Ms. Mills’s tenure at the department, Mr. Kim’s company,   became a donor to the Clinton Foundation, through its Clinton Global Initiative, and Ms. Mills remained involved in foundation matters. According to emails hacked from the accounts of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, and released by WikiLeaks, Ms. Mills helped draft memos and consulted on internal organizational issues at the foundation, though she used her personal Gmail account and not her government email. Another close Clinton aide at the State Department, Huma Abedin, was for a time permitted to work for the foundation and an outside consulting firm while serving as a “special government employee. ” Ms. Mills was also granted the same special designation after leaving the department, during the period when she was getting BlackIvy off the ground. The unpaid,   government role was “solely focused on Haiti” and did not involve her activities at BlackIvy, according to her spokesman, Eric London. Since teaming up through BlackIvy, Ms. Mills and Mr. Kim have maintained close business ties, appearing together last year for the opening of a new   factory in Costa Rica where they cut the ribbon alongside Costa Rica’s president, Luis Guillermo Solís. In Africa, representatives of the United States Agency for International Development have consulted with BlackIvy and   about efforts to expand the textile trade in Ghana, where BlackIvy says the country’s     minimum wage “compares favorably” to higher wages in China, Bangladesh and Vietnam. Federal officials are barred from using their positions to negotiate future employment or exchange services for something of value, and no evidence has emerged to suggest that occurred with BlackIvy. Both Ms. Mills and Mr. Kim deny that his investment was influenced by the substantial assistance she provided his company while serving as Mrs. Clinton’s right hand at the State Department. Ms. Mills, 51, declined to be interviewed for this article, but Mr. London, a BlackIvy spokesman, said she had consulted with the State Department ethics office before accepting Mr. Kim’s investment “to ensure it was consistent with any rules that applied to her because of her service. ” “Ms. Mills and Mr. Kim met during her work for the State Department in Haiti during earthquake reconstruction,” Mr. London said. “She had no personal business ventures and no discussions about any prospective business with Mr. Kim while she was at State. ” Karen Seo, a spokeswoman for   said the State Department’s assistance in Haiti played no role in Mr. Kim’s decision to invest in BlackIvy. His discussions about making the investment began in “late 2014,” she said, more than a year after Ms. Mills had left the government. Ms. Seo said that   “currently has no plans to invest in garment and textile manufacturing facilities in Africa,” and that Ms. Mills had no business relationship with   outside of BlackIvy, adding that her appearance with Mr. Kim at the   factory opening in Costa Rica was of a social nature. “Ms. Mills was invited and came to the Costa Rica event as a friend, as did many others,” she said. Ms. Mills first gained public notice in the 1990s as a member of the legal team that defended President Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial. A graduate of Stanford Law School, she worked for Mrs. Clinton’s unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign. While she has said she has no formal role with Mrs. Clinton’s current campaign for president, she remains a close confidante  —   she was one of the few people aware of Mrs. Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis days before it was made public. While at the State Department, Ms. Mills took the lead on a number of projects important to Mrs. Clinton, perhaps none more so than Haiti. Even before the January 2010 earthquake, the impoverished Caribbean nation was the focus of attention from the Clintons. Mr. Clinton, whose foundation is active there, had been named a United Nations special envoy to Haiti, and as early as April 2009, just a few months after becoming secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton was being forwarded emails from Ms. Mills containing economic development ideas. Some of those ideas were from   Warnholz, an economist whose consulting business provided “intelligence on African markets. ” In emails and meetings with the Clintons and Ms. Mills, he advocated investment in textiles and agriculture as a way to create jobs, a theory that was   in Haiti after the earthquake with a proposal for an industrial park anchored by a major garment factory. Ms. Mills soon hired Mr. Warnholz as her own adviser at the State Department  —   he would later join her at BlackIvy  —   and the two worked closely to push the industrial park concept. After overtures to another South Korean garment company fell through, Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Mills met with   Trading executives during a trip to Seoul to pitch the idea.   supplies clothing to some of the largest American retailers, including Walmart and Kohl’s, and has been accused of illegal tactics against union organizers at a plant in Guatemala, charges the company disputes. Ultimately, the United States provided about $124 million to develop a power plant, housing and other improvements for the Haiti industrial park, while an international development bank contributed $100 million and the Haitians provided the land.   agreed to invest $78 million.   was blunt about the need to make the deal worth the money. “This is business,” a company spokesman said at the time. “At the end of the day, it’s about making a profit. ” In addition to being good for   the Haiti project recast the   Mr. Kim as the sort of enlightened global capitalist the Clintons favor, earning him appearances at the Clinton Global Initiative and other international forums. When the industrial park opened for business in October 2012, the Clintons were on hand for the celebration. Mrs. Clinton thanked Mr. Kim “for everything that you and the leadership of   is doing,” and she praised Ms. Mills for being the “real driver of our government’s support for everything that we see here today. ” Six months after she resigned from the State Department in February 2013, Ms. Mills incorporated BlackIvy Group. She has described it as a “private operating company that builds commercial enterprises in   Africa. ” Mr. Kim was among a handful of prominent investors in BlackIvy, according to a description that was once on BlackIvy’s website but has since been removed. The deleted page carried the heading “Our Team” and listed, in addition to Mr. Kim: Continental Grain, a multinational agribusiness with operations in Haiti Steve Case, the founder of AOL the Wall Street financier John Mack the hedge fund founder Raymond Dalio and Beck, Mack  Oliver, an investment firm. The executive chairman of BlackIvy is Anthony Welters, a retired health insurance executive and longtime friend and mentor to Ms. Mills who has raised money for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. His son, Bryant, works for BlackIvy, and his wife, Beatrice Wilkinson Welters, was the American ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago from 2010 to 2012. In July, two BlackIvy representatives, including Bryant Welters, met with government leaders in Trinidad, part of what the prime minister’s office there said was a visit to explore “avenues for doing business with Trinidad and Tobago. ” Asked why BlackIvy was in the Caribbean, far outside its stated market areas in Africa, the company’s spokesman, Mr. London, said it had nothing to do with Ms. Welters’s connections as a former ambassador. BlackIvy, he said, was not actually seeking business in Trinidad, but met with companies there “to learn about their successes in the region and to explore opportunities for them to establish operations in Ghana and replicate those successes. ” What BlackIvy has accomplished so far is not clear. It signed an agreement with officials in Tanzania to develop a transportation hub, but media reports there suggest it is progressing slowly. A Tanzanian government audit in March questioned how BlackIvy was chosen, saying “there was no evidence” it was through a competitive bidding process. Mr. London said competitive bidding was not needed because BlackIvy’s project is privately funded and there is no financial risk to the government. In Ghana, where BlackIvy has been pursuing an industrial park project, a PowerPoint presentation prepared by BlackIvy cited the country’s low minimum wage as one of several competitive advantages that made Ghana “an ideal entry point to the West African market. ” Defending the model of attracting investment with promises of cheap labor, Mr. London offered an argument very similar to the one American officials made when explaining why  ’s factory would be good for Haiti. “The industrial park will increase manufacturing in Ghana  —   creating jobs and catalyzing growth  —   which benefits the country and investors,” he said. “Wages usually rise when manufacturing sectors expand and produce   goods, which is what we want to see in Ghana. ” BlackIvy’s rationale did not sway labor advocates like Scott Nova, the executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, who had criticized the Haiti project as a misguided American relief effort that glossed over  ’s   history. “When you urge garment manufacturers producing in countries like Bangladesh, where wages are far too low for workers to adequately support their families, to move production to countries with even lower wages, it undercuts the efforts of apparel workers across the Global South to persuade governments, employers and major apparel brands to lift wages to a decent level,” Mr. Nova said.",0
