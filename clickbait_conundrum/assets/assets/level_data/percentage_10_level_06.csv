63816,FOX LEGAL EXPERT CALLS OUT ‘PARTIAL’ MUELLER: Must Resign After Latest Hire Who Was Appointed by Obama [Video],"Gregg Jarrett says Mueller must resign after his latest new hire for the panel of lawyers. The entire panel is biased. In addition, Mueller was the FBI Director and Comey the DA for the Southern District New York for the Clinton/Rich investigation, after Rich s wife donated money to the Clinton library and Hillary campaign.Mueller has hired 16 very far left lawyers! He should resign!Our Previous Report on Mueller:  Are there any Trump donors on the team? GREAT QUESTION BY TOM FITTON! Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton joined FOX News to explain Mueller s latest hire of Andrew Goldstein, a former prosecutor who worked under Preet Bharara in New York. Remember Prett Bharara? Trump fired him! Fitton questioned who is overseeing Mueller s day-to-day conduct, pointing to the 12 hires he has made for his legal team all liberal political hacks!Special Counsel Mueller s investigation is out of control. @realDonaldTrump DOJ should shut it down. https://t.co/IYr9Hiqkix  Tom Fitton (@TomFitton) July 2, 2017A VERY KEY REASON FOR THIS WITCH HUNT TO END IS THAT: Several of the lawyers donated to Democrats and it seems that the team is  searching for a crime. Fitton said:  I don t understand what this investigation is about.. You know my count is 14, 15 lawyers to have working on this one investigation to investigate to investigate what? An employment dispute between Comey and the President? You have the conflicts caused by Comey leaking records to get Mueller appointed, you have Constitutional concerns about the way the office operates. Fitton then pointed out what s a big concern for most people watching this unfold:  Are there any Trump donors on the team? IN CASE YOU HAVEN T HEARD   HERE S OUR RECENT REPORT ON THE LOPSIDED GROUP OF ALL DEMOCRAT DONOR LAWYERS HELPING MUELLER TRY AND BURY TRUMP:Former NH Governor John Sununu let Alison Camarata have it when she asked about the Russia investigation and Robert Mueller. Sununu said that Trump should have been notified if he was under investigation and then he slammed Mueller for hiring all Dems.Camerota:  Should the White House know if the President is being investigated for obstruction of justice? Sununu:  If the President is being investigated for obstruction of justice, the White House should have been officially notified. Sununu:  What bothers me the most and there must be a reason for it, is Mueller making four of his first hires so blatantly biased lawyers, pro-Democrat lawyers with a bias certainly against the President. Maybe Mueller has decided internally that this isn t going anywhere and that the only way he can have credibility on a decision saying that there s nothing there is to have that decision come from a group of lawyers that are so blatantly biased against the President. CNN Reports   Three members of the legal team known to have been hired so far by special counsel Robert Mueller to handle the Russia investigation have given political donations almost exclusively to Democrats, according to a CNN analysis of Federal Election Commission records.",1
15690," With The Death Of Alton Sterling, Police Have Now Killed 114 Black Men So Far This Year","Outraged protesters have taken to the streets of Baton Rouge, Lousiana following the shooting death of Alton Sterling. Early Tuesday morning, the 37-year-old African-American man was gunned down by police officers while they had him pinned to the ground. Video taken by witnesses shows Sterling being held down while he pleads with officers. You can hear one of the officers yell,  You fucking move, I swear to God,  and then shots ring out.*Trigger warning*37-year-old #AltonSterling shot and killed by a Baton Rouge police officer. pic.twitter.com/xJRm500its  Philip Lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) July 6, 2016In that horrifying instant, Sterling became the 114th black man to die at the hands of law enforcement so far this year, according to a Washington Post investigation. It should also be noted that this number is just the deaths that we know of, the true number could be even higher still. With only 186 days having passed in 2016, this means that police officers in the United States are killing African-American men at a rate of almost one a day.Abdul Muflahi owns the Triple S Food Mart that Sterling was killed in front of and took the video of the killing, which has now gone viral. Although authorities have not confirmed whether or not the gun they spoke of in the video was recovered, Muflahi said that they did find one in his pocket. However, the witness insists that Sterling s hands never went anywhere near his pockets or the gun at any point during the struggle.Muflahi added that the responding officers  were really aggressive with him from the start. Mignon Chambers, Sterling s sister, said that her brother would often sell CD s in front of Muflahi s store.The police shooting of yet another black man has once again sparked protests, an all too familiar scenario in America. The Advocate s Bryn Stole was on the scene as the protests were taking place.

54473,Megyn Kelly Bombshell: Leaked Passage From Book Reveals Roger Ailes Sexually Assaulted Her Too,"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
A leaked passage from Megyn Kelly’s new book reveals that her perverted boss, Roger Ailes, offered to advance the Fox host’s career in exchange for “sexual favors.” 
Kelly’s book, titled Settle For More , is set to be released on November 15. In the book, she reportedly reveals that Ailes targeted her as well as many of the other women at Fox News. The harassment took place early on during Kelly’s time at Fox News, beginning in 2005. The managing editor came to her and told her that she had “captured the attention of Mr. Ailes.” She would soon learn just what this meant during the first of several meetings at his office in Manhattan. 
“Roger began pushing the limits,” she alleges. “There was a pattern to his behavior. I would be called into Roger’s office, he would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with me — veering between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e.g. about the ‘very sexy bras’ I must have and how he’d like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice.” 
But things didn’t stop there. Radar reports : 
“He offered to advance her career ‘in exchange for sexual favors,’ she writes, and even though she says she rejected ‘every single one,’ she claims he tried ‘physical advances.'” 
“But in January 2006, she claims, he ‘crossed a new line — trying to grab me repeatedly and kiss me on the lips.’ When she shoved him away, she alleges, ‘he asked me an ominous question: ‘When is your contract up?’ And then, for the third time, he tried to kiss me.’ ” 
Kelly stayed conspicuously quiet when former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson came forward and filed a lawsuit against Ailes accusing him of sexual harassment. In her book, Kelly says that Ailes launched an “intense campaign” to convince her to speak out on his behalf when Carlson first filed her claim against him. 
“I was approached several times, and several times I refused,” she writes. “There was no way I was going to lie to protect him.” 
The revelation confirms what most of us already assumed. After all, it wasn’t likely that a dirty old man like Ailes would go after so many other women at the network and not target the pretty young starlet. Until now, though, this had not been confirmed by Kelly. She said in her book that she finally decided it was time to speak out, even though there could be serious consequences. 
“Crossing him was a major risk,” she said, “but what if — God forbid — he was still doing it to someone?” 
The passages regarding Ailes were reportedly added to the book after the rest of it had been completed. The book’s publisher is HarperCollins, which is owned by the same media company as Fox, who fired Ailes after Carlson filed suit against him. 
Radar also noted that Kelly has stressed “that though she rebuffed all of his advances, he [Ailes] never went through with his implied threat of revenge. Instead, he promoted her.”

46990,BREAKING: THE SUPREME COURT RULES AGAINST THE EPA ON POWER PLANT REGULATIONS,"SHOCKER! Great news that the EPA was shot down on their overreaching regulations. Justice Scalia got this one right when he wrote that it s not appropriate to impose billions of dollars of economic costs for little benefit in return.The Supreme Court has ruled against federal regulators  attempt to limit power plant emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants.The rules began to take effect in April, but the court said by a 5-4 vote Monday that the Environmental Protection Agency failed to take their cost into account when the agency first decided to regulate the toxic emissions from coal- and oil-fired plants.The challenge was brought by industry groups and 21 Republican-led states.Writing for the court, Justice Antonin Scalia said it is not appropriate to impose billions of dollars of economic costs in return for a few dollars in health or environmental benefits.The case now goes back to lower courts for the EPA to decide how to account for costs.",1
55997," Anonymous GOP Reps Admit Clinton Will Win, Blame Trump’s Stupidity","Republicans are already predicting doom and gloom for November. Since Donald Trump seems not to grasp what  get on message  means (they ve been telling him to do that for months), members of the Republican Party are already predicting Hillary Clinton as the victor.In an exclusive with The Hill, several members of the House GOP caucus under anonymity, who back Trump, now say they are preparing for a Clinton sweep in November.One  Southern lawmaker,  who is a Trump supporter, told the Hill:I m not feeling great about the immediate future of the conservative movement right now. As a conservative who believes our ideas are good for America, it is pretty gloomy these days.The southern lawmaker acknowledged Trump would be a difficult candidate to sell to the American people, considering the GOP s lack of a coalition with women, minorities, LGBT, and youth voters (yet they re still a Trump supporter), which means they don t care about the bran issues facing their party. There was some hope that the disaffected, so-called silent majority would be broad enough and turn out in large enough numbers to give Trump a chance. But if he continues the next 90 days like the last week, then he will lose big time,  the southern lawmaker told the Hill.One  Northeastern lawmaker  was more candid with his feelings:I think it will be Hillary. If I had to bet, I d definitely  bet that Trump loses. This is like a football game where you hate both teams. You root for a tie   and maybe some minor injuries.Right now, it sucks to be a Republican. Rep. Matt Salmon, who originally backed Marco Rubio, then Ted Cruz and now Trump, admitted a Trump win will be a  steep climb.  That s because the GOP didn t listen to their 2012 autopsy report, and they are paying the price. But not all members of the GOP are ignoring the findings from their last loss in 2012. Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania told the Hill that the GOP must learn from their autopsy report if they hope to win:Another autopsy will occur, and the next time I hope lessons will be learned.Fat chance that will happen. They seriously thought Romney was going to beat President Obama, and decided to disregard all the points they missed when he didn t win.The GOP is bracing for a Clinton win, and so is the rest of he country   anything is better than Donald Trump.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",1

47371,OBAMA JUST GAVE TERRORISTS INCENTIVE TO KIDNAP AMERICANS WITH RECKLESS NEW HOSTAGE POLICY,"THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS TO BE THE MOST BUMBLING AND CLUELESS ONE EVER! They ve just incentivized kidnapping and holding hostage anyone and everyone the terrorists think they can get a ransom out of. Brilliant GENERAL JOHN R. ALLEN ON RANSOM FOR HOSTAGES: What is hard to prove is how many Americans have not been kidnapped as a result of the fact that the enemy knows they will not get a penny from us,  said Gen. John R. Allen, who recently retired as the top commander in Afghanistan. The fact that there are Americans in the region who were never taken because they knew there was no advantage to doing so needs to be factored in. The Obama administration was accused Wednesday of giving terrorists an incentive to kidnap as it unveiled a hostage policy overhaul allowing families of U.S. hostages to pay ransom   and allowing the U.S. government to help families communicate with captors. This doesn t fix anything,  Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., a leading critic of the administration s hostage policy, told Fox News.  The money that we re going to be paying ISIS is going to be used to buy arms and to buy equipment to fight Americans and to fight the Iraqis. But the White House said the changes are being unveiled with the families and victims in mind. We re not going to abandon you. We re going to stand by you,  Obama said of hostages  families, speaking at the White House on Wednesday.The policy review was formally released shortly before noon, and includes a host of changes beyond the clarifications on ransom discussions   notably, the creation of a new bureaucratic structure for handling hostage cases.The White House plans to establish a Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell responsible for coordinating the recovery of hostages; a Hostage Response Group responsible for coordinating hostage policies; and the position of  special presidential envoy for hostage affairs.  Obama said this is being done to sync up various efforts, citing past coordination problems.Read more: FOX News",1
3051,Turkeys vote for Christmas,"  Gobbles addresses an angry crowd 
In a shock election result, turkeys have voted in favour of Christmas for the first time since they gained the right to hold elections in 1845. In every year since then, turkeys have voted firmly against the Yuletide feast. However, this year a populist right-wing turkey called Steve ""Paxo"" has managed the impossible, and persuaded turkeys to vote for Christmas. 
During the campaign, Paxo was helped by his sinister propaganda adviser, Gobbles, and made a series of promises to the other turkeys. He said that he would take back control of Christmas, and make it great again. He promised to ban the eating of turkeys at Christmas, although he has no power to enforce this. He also said that all the money spent on killing turkeys at Christmas could instead be used to provide free chocolate and HDTV to all turkeys. 
The win seems to have surprised even Gobbles and Paxo, and they began to backtrack on their pledges almost immediately.""Of course when we said we would take back control of Christmas we meant in a non-literal sense,"" said Gobbles. ""It is likely that many turkeys will be slaughtered this year anyway."" 
Some turkeys were disappointed with the result. Mr Clucky voted for Christmas but is beginning to regret it. ""I've had a rough year,"" he said. ""My cage is a mess and I thought voting for Christmas would fix it all. They promised so much."" 
No turkey farmers are thought to be considering taking the result seriously. In any case, the turkeys voted in favour of Christmas, so there is actually less controversy this year than when the birds have voted against it. Farmer Arse of Norwich said, ""Them turkeys is as dumb as chickens. They deserve everything they get."" Make Sir Geoffroy Cockface's  ",1
18048, Keith Olbermann: Donald Trump Wants To Protect The Right To Poison Dogs (VIDEO),"Four years ago, many complained about the fact that Mitt Romney once took a vacation with his dog strapped to the top of his car. That might not have been the ultimate demise of the Romney campaign, but for people who love animals, it demonstrated a cruel streak that many said made him unfit to be president.Donald Trump doesn t have a dog story quite like that, mainly because there s no record he s ever had a dog, or for that matter, any pet. While that isn t in and of itself that unusual, Trump has repeatedly shown that he too has a cruel streak when it comes to animals, and in particular, dogs.Keith Olbermann hilariously demonstrated that in a video,  Why is Donald Trump Such a Weirdo About Dogs? In the video, Olbermann shows several tweets and comments from Trump about people being  fired like a dog,  or  kicked out of the ABC news debate  like a dog,'  or  begging for money  like a dog.'  Mitt Romney  choked like a dog,  according to Trump. Clearly, dogs don t get fired from jobs. They don t beg for money (although it s not above them to beg for treats).For Olbermann, the most ridiculous  like a dog  comment to come from Trump was when he accused Marco Rubio of  sweating like a dog.  Anyone who knows anything at all about dogs, knows that dogs don t sweat. They do pant, though, and that can make them very thirsty, so I suppose there is a Rubio comparison to dogs, just not that one. People who don t have dogs still know about dogs,  Olbermann said.  What the hell? Is he from Mars? The far, far bigger issue, though, has nothing to do with tweets or silly rhetoric. It has everything to do with how he ll do and what he ll do as President of the United States. Trump, like pretty much all Republicans, sees regulations as obstacles to his getting even wealthier than he is.In a press release that has since been pulled off the internet, Trump complained about the  FDA Food Police,  and complained that the federal government  expects farmers to produce fruits and vegetables and even dictates the nutritional content of dog food.  (emphasis added).As Olbermann pointed out, in the last year, 11 of the 23 pet food recalls from the FDA have been because dog food manufacturers were poisoning dogs. That s when Olbermann, visibly angry, said that Trump has hinted that as a president,  he would protect a business man s right to poison dogs. Here s the video:Could you really trust a POTUS who has never had a dog? And, y know, wants to protect businesses who poison them? pic.twitter.com/NykVqnG6Nj  Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) October 3, 2016Upwards of half of all Americans own pets. Beyond that, cruelty to animals is a major indicator of other psychological problems, including psychopathy. In other words, you don t have to be a dog owner to see that Trump s attitude toward dogs sets a dangerous precedent for how he d run the country.Featured image of Donald Trump via Spencer Platt/Getty Images | Featured image of dog via Noel Vasquez/Getty Images.",1
8837,Irony Redefined: “Human Rights Champion” Suu Kyi Jails Dissidents,"By Tony Cartalucci 
Myanmar’s defacto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi of the National League for Democracy (NDL) political party, has paved her time since coming to power earlier this year with both irony and hypocrisy. She has not only illegally declared herself “leader” of the Southeast Asian state in contravention of its constitution, she has also embarked on an iron-fisted purge of her political opponents identical to the one she fought against as she struggled to seize power to begin with. 
During elections earlier this year, Myanmar’s constitution prevented Suu Kyi from holding the nation’s highest office due to her inordinate amount of time overseas, her status of having been married to a foreign, and her children’s dual citizenship. Instead of adhering to the law, her party once in power, simply contrived an entirely new post for her, State Counsellor of Myanmar, which makes her the “defacto leader” of Myanmar. 
Canada’s The Globe and Mail in an article titled, “Stéphane Dion says Aung San Suu Kyi is the ‘de facto’ leader of Myanmar,” would note that Canada’s government recognized this legal side-stepping, stating: 
Dion called Suu Kyi, now Myanmar’s foreign minister, “the de facto national leader” of her country “because they have a strange rule that if you have married somebody who’s not of the country, you cannot be the leader of the government and of the state.” 
Suu Kyi, the internationally recognized democracy advocate, is barred from becoming president because her late husband was British, as are her two sons. The rule was crafted during Myanmar’s decades of military rule, which Suu Kyi fought against during years of house arrest before finally prevailing last fall. 
In essence, she is unelected, and illegally holding power. For a woman who’s Western backers – particularly in the United States and United Kingdom – have held her up as a champion for democracy and the rule of law, she and her party’s first act upon taking power was trampling both. The Inhumane Humanitarian 
Another myth built up around Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi by the West has been her advocacy for “human rights.” Her advocacy for human rights, however, appears only to extend out to protect only as far as her immediate political allies are concerned. For groups beyond this self-serving political protection, and particularly regarding her political opponents, she and her NDL are just as eager to jail, crush, or kill political opponents as they claimed the ruling military government had been. 
In addition to escalating violence targeting the nation’s Rohingya’s population, several activists online have been sent to jail for “insulting” the ruling government and Western-backed media fronts and organizations. 
Myanmar’s Eleven Media Group (EMG) in its article, “Facebook offender brought to court for insulting Suu Kyi,” attempted to distance what Suu Kyi and her political supporters had once called draconian censorship as now, a simple matter of enforcing the law. It would state: 
A Facebook user named Zaw Zaw (aka Nga Pha) was brought to the North Dagon Township court on October 24 to face prosecution for his defamatory posts about State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. 
He has been charged under Section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Law. 
“He’s being sued for defamatory writing and photos about the State Counsellor [posted on Facebook],” said plaintiff Nay Myo Kyaw, a 34-year-old resident of North Okkalapa Township. 
Around 50 people showed up at the hearing wearing shirts affiliated with a group called the Network of Supporters of the Rule of Law. They shouted: “You deserved it for insulting a good person.” 
The article also admits: 
The Myawady Township Court sentenced Aung Win Hlaing (aka A Nyar Thar), the first man to be prosecuted under the current government, for defamatory posts on Facebook about President Htin Kyaw, to nine months in jail after he was convicted under Section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Law. 
Aung Myint Tun (aka Ko Pho Htaung), a member of the National League for Democracy, is still facing legal action under the same law for the wording of a resignation letter. 
Another man named Yar Pyay was arrested and is being prosecuted for creating a fake Facebook account under the name of Nay Myo Wai, the chairman of Peace and Diversity Party. 
Hla Phone was also arrested and is being prosecuted for defamatory posts on Facebook about the Commander-in-Chief. 
EMG – ironically awarded for its work in opposing the previous military-led government by Reporters without Borders – would also admit that it itself had taken advantage of Myanmar’s laws to silence its own critics, claiming: 
Eleven Media Group (EMG) also filed complaints about repeated defamatory posts on Facebook against the group. Though EMG lodged complaints against film director Mike Tee, who is the owner of a Facebook account named Than Tun Zaw, and another Facebook user named Myat Maw for offensive posts about the group and its staff, the legal process has yet to begin. EMG lodged the complaints on January 27 and March 31 this year. 
One would expect such a tidal wave of abuse – as defined by the West in regards to media, governance, and censorship around the world – to be met with sweeping condemnation from the West’s various human rights advocacy organizations including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and a no doubt embarrassed Reporters Without Borders – yet the silence is as deafening as it is telling. Taking Over Where Accused Dictators Left Off 
The West’s champions of democracy, rule of law, and human rights in Myanmar appears to have simply taken over right where Suu Kyi and her NDL party had claimed the military-led government left off. And despite the overt nature of Suu Kyi’s breaches of Western standards of “democracy” and “human rights,” the US is on track to lift all sanctions from Myanmar as Suu Kyi and her government open the nation, its people, and its resources to exploitation by Western corporations. 
The overt nature of both the West’s and Suu Kyi’s hypocrisy illustrates that “democracy,” “rule of law,” and “human rights” are merely facades behind which the West and its proxies wield their power – hiding behind such principles rather than truly upholding them. And in reality, such behavior undermines these principles more than any overt abuse by an openly tyrannical regime ever could – because genuine advocates thus become associated with hypocrites like the Western governments supporting the current regime in Myanmar, their faux-nongovernmental organizations aiding and abetting the regime, and proxies like Suu Kyi and her NDL themselves. 
International audiences must keep this example of hypocrisy in mind as the West attempts to overturn other governments in Southeast Asia and beyond under similar pretexts and using similar rhetoric – supporting supposed “pro-democracy” and “pro-human rights” advocates who have every intention of trampling both upon seizing power.

Kaine is now going on the record about the effort from within that threatens to distort the results of the race and put a thumb on the scale in Donald Trump s favor.Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) suggested Saturday that some officials at the FBI are  actively working  to support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.[ ]Kaine called the FBI a  leaky sieve  and criticized director James B. Comey for breaking agency protocol by discussing a politically sensitive case so close to an election. He also dismissed former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani s decision to back off claims that he was given advance notice of the FBI s plans to possibly reopen the Clinton investigation.The surprise announcement from the FBI director is a violation of the agency s rules, and it ricocheted through the media in a negative light for Clinton. Follow-up reporting has indicated that many of the emails   if not all of them   found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner s laptop were not even to or from Clinton.The Trump campaign was delighted to have the news to attack Clinton with on the campaign trail, fueling the desire on the right to chant  lock her up,  a dangerous idea that many have compared to the third-world tactics of dictators in banana republics.Subsequent reporting appears to indicate a war roiling the FBI itself, which some conservative forces are attempting to use to prevent Clinton s election, while others oppose such blatant interference in the race.Despite the unprecedented nature of the leaks and the director s actions, the political damage to Clinton does not appear to be significant. Most national polling and analysis of the polls shows a likely win, despite FBI obstruction.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video ",1
8282,WATCH: DIVISIVE FORMER First Lady MICHELLE OBAMA Can’t Let Go Of Race-Obsession: People “Don’t Trust Politics” Because Republicans Are All “White Men”,"Michelle Obama is hands-down, the most divisive first lady to ever occupy our nation s White House. The woman who was never proud of her country until her husband was elected President, lived a very comfortable life as the First Lady in the nation s White House. She took regular 5-star vacations, that included her tax-supported live-in mother, friends, relatives, and of course, her daughters, who attended the best schools in Washington DC. After 8 long years of acting as the First Lady of the United States of America, it s actually quite sad to see Michelle travel around from venue to venue, explaining to her audiences how she s still a victim of racism or sexism Tuesday at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women, former first lady Michelle Obama said when she attended the State of the Union address she would notice the Republican side was  all men, all white,  and that was why she argued many people of color  don t trust politics. Speaking about diversity, Obama said,  We should be working actively to mix it up, so we re getting a real broad range of perspectives on every issue. Shoot, I would see that in Congress. She explained,  At the State of the Union address   when you are in the room what you can see is this real dichotomy. It s a feeling of color almost. On one side of the room is literally gray and white. Literally, that is the color palette on one side of the room. On the other side of the room, there are yellows and blues and whites and greens. Physically, there s a difference in color, in the tone, because on one side all men, all white, on the other side some woman, some people of color. She continued,  I look at that, and I go, no wonder. No wonder we struggle, no wonder people don t trust politics. We re not even noticing what these rooms look like.    Breitbart ",1

8361,"Trump, Australia's Turnbull move to clear air after tense phone call","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump held his first-face-to-face meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Thursday, and declared that they “get along great,” following an acrimonious phone call in January that strained ties between the two allies.     “They said we had a rough phone call. We didn’t really have a rough phone call,” Trump said in dinner remarks. “It got a little bit testy. But that’s okay.” Dressed in tuxedos as they prepared to attend a dinner, the two leaders met on board the USS Intrepid, a World War Two aircraft carrier that is now a museum moored on Manhattan’s West Side.

Turnbull was one of the first foreign leaders Trump spoke to after taking office on Jan. 20.

Trump had broken off what was supposed to be an hour-long call after 25 minutes and later tweeted that the refugee agreement was a “dumb deal” and vowed to study it. The call aroused criticism and raised questions about his diplomatic skills. Vice President Mike Pence visited Australia in April and made clear that while Trump was not happy about the refugee agreement, the United States would honor it out of respect for Australia. Under the agreement, Australia is to resettle refugees from three Central American countries. Thursday’s get-together with Turnbull was delayed because of Trump’s hastily arranged White House celebration with Republicans from the U.S. House of Representatives after they narrowly passed a healthcare bill that would repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. The measure has yet to come before the Senate/    Trump and Turnbull were all smiles as they answered questions about the January phone call and the refugee deal during a picture-taking session. “We get along great. We have a fantastic relationship, I love Australia, I always have,” Trump said. Turnbull added: “We can put the refugee deal behind you and move on.” Trump said the refugee deal had been “worked out for a long time” and that reporters had exaggerated the phone call. “We had a great call,” he said, adding, “I mean, we’re not babies.” “Young at heart,” added Turnbull. Trump vowed to visit Australia as president, calling it “one of the great, great places” and noted he had many friends there. One such friend, pro golfer Greg Norman, was among the attendees at the Intrepid dinner. In dinner remarks after their meeting, Turnbull celebrated the unity of spirit that brought the two countries together against Japan in World War Two, and said Australia and the United States are united against North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs and are fighting together in Afghanistan. “Today and together, we condemn and we resist North Korea’s provocation,” he said. It was Trump’s first trip back to New York, his home and where he made his name and fortune, since the former real estate executive moved into the White House in January. His motorcade passed hundreds of protesters as it arrived at the Intrepid in the early evening. Trump did not plan to visit Trump Tower, his home in midtown Manhattan where his wife, first lady Melania Trump, and their young son Barron still live, but instead was to spend the weekend at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey.

43706, GOP Sent Armed Agents To Harass Clinton Aide And Used Your Tax Dollars To Do It,"Republicans in Congress used tax dollars to send armed agents to harass a former aide to Secretary Hillary Clinton as part of the never-ending fishing expedition into Clinton s emails.Bryan Pagliano was a tech aide who helped to set up the server for Clinton s emails, and has made top Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee angry because he is asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refuses to testify.It is unclear why they need his testimony. The FBI and Department of Justice have already determined that Clinton s use of the email server does not warrant prosecution.But Republicans on the committee decided to flex their muscle anyways:But when the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee subpoenaed Pagliano last week, his lawyers said he would again assert his Fifth Amendment rights. They added that he was willing to meet with the committee in private to make that assertion, but was unwilling to do so under the glare of television cameras in a public event.That prompted Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) to dispatch the armed marshals with a fresh subpoena last Friday, Chaffetz revealed in Thursday s hearing. To clear up any ambiguity created by Mr. Pagliano s six lawyers about whether they would confirm service of the prior subpoenas   which they refused to do   we had the U.S. marshals personally serve him,  Chaffetz said.The political stunt was slammed by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) who said,  This served no purpose but to harass and intimidate Mr. Pagliano. The chairman ordered this action in secret, without even notifying Democratic committee members of his plan.  No consultation, no debate, no vote. Republicans have sought to use their control of congress as a government funded super PAC to attack Clinton. In addition to her emails, Republicans have created multiple committees investigating the attack on U.S. personnel in Benghazi. All of these committees have cleared Clinton and President Obama of wrongdoing, but the GOP leadership insists on wasting more and more money on these cases.And it is all financed by taxpayers.Featured image via Flickr",1
61653,BRILLIANT AND TRUE: THIS IS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE FAILURE OF BALTIMORE’S LEADERS,"Kevin D. Williamson of National Review nails it in this brilliant and true piece! This is so worth the time! This all encompassing look at Baltimore and the failed Democratic city governments gives us the problem and the solution. All I can say is Amen!A few weeks ago, there was an election in Ferguson, Mo., the result of which was to treble the number of African Americans on that unhappy suburb s city council. This was greeted in some corners with optimism   now, at last, the city s black residents would have a chance to see to securing their own interests. This optimism flies in the face of evidence near   St. Louis   and far   Baltimore, Detroit, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco . . .St. Louis has not had a Republican mayor since the 1940s, and in its most recent elections for the board of aldermen there was no Republican in the majority of the contests; the city is overwhelmingly Democratic, effectively a single-party political monopoly from its schools to its police department. Baltimore has seen two Republicans sit in the mayor s office since the 1920s   and none since the 1960s. Like St. Louis, it is effectively a single-party political monopoly from its schools to its police department. Philadelphia has not elected a Republican mayor since 1948. The last Republican to be elected mayor of Detroit was congratulated on his victory by President Eisenhower. Atlanta, a city so corrupt that its public schools are organized as a criminal conspiracy against its children, last had a Republican mayor in the 19th century. Its municipal elections are officially nonpartisan, but the last Republican to run in Atlanta s 13th congressional district did not manage to secure even 30 percent of the vote; Atlanta is effectively a single-party political monopoly from its schools to its police department.American cities are by and large Democratic-party monopolies, monopolies generally dominated by the so-called progressive wing of the party. The results have been catastrophic, and not only in poor black cities such as Baltimore and Detroit. Money can paper over some of the defects of progressivism in rich, white cities such as Portland and San Francisco, but those are pretty awful places to be non-white and non-rich, too: Blacks make up barely 9 percent of the population in San Francisco, but they represent 40 percent of those arrested for murder, and they are arrested for drug offenses at ten times their share of the population. Criminals make their own choices, sure, but you want to take a look at the racial disparity in educational outcomes and tell me that those low-income nine-year-olds in Wisconsin just need to buck up and bootstrap it?Black urban communities face institutional failure across the board every day. There are people who should be made to answer for that: What has Martin O Malley to say for himself? What can Ed Rendell say for himself other than that he secured a great deal of investment for the richest square mile in Philadelphia? What has Nancy Pelosi done about the radical racial divide in San Francisco? DETROIT IN RUINS: Mychal Denzel Smith, toy radical at The Nation, offered the usual illiterate slogan  f**k the police  and declared of the rioters:  I also hope they break s**t.  Writers at Salon also endorsed violence for its own sake.  I do not advocate non-violence,  Benji Hart affirmed. Most of this can be credited to juvenile posturing, and it should be noted that the rioters in Baltimore mostly are not burning down tax offices or police stations but are in the main looting businesses and carrying out acts of wanton opportunistic vandalism   that s not a revolt, but a crime spree. Meretricious  black rage  rhetoric notwithstanding, what we have seen in places such as Ferguson and Baltimore is much more ordinarily criminal than political.But there is a legitimate concern here   from which no one seems to be willing to draw the obvious conclusion: There is someone to blame for what s wrong in Baltimore.Would any sentient adult American be shocked to learn that Baltimore has a corrupt and feckless police department enabled by a corrupt and feckless city government? I myself would not, and the local authorities  dishonesty and stonewalling in the death of Freddie Gray is reminiscent of what we have seen in other cities. There s a heap of evidence that the Baltimore police department is pretty bad.This did not come out of nowhere. While the progressives have been running the show in Baltimore, police commissioner Ed Norris was sent to prison on corruption charges (2004), two detectives were sentenced to 454 years in prison for dealing drugs (2005), an officer was dismissed after being videotaped verbally abusing a 14-year-old and then failing to file a report on his use of force against the same teenager (2011), an officer was been fired for sexually abusing a minor (2014), and the city paid a quarter-million-dollar settlement to a man police illegally arrested for the non-crime of recording them at work with his mobile phone. There s a good deal more. Does that sound like a disciplined police organization to you?Yes, Baltimore seems to have some police problems. But let us be clear about whose fecklessness and dishonesty we are talking about here: No Republican, and certainly no conservative, has left so much as a thumbprint on the public institutions of Baltimore in a generation. Baltimore s police department is, like Detroit s economy and Atlanta s schools, the product of the progressive wing of the Democratic party enabled in no small part by black identity politics. This is entirely a left-wing project, and a Democratic-party project.When will the Left be held to account for the brutality in Baltimore   brutality for which it bears a measure of responsibility on both sides? There aren t any Republicans out there cheering on the looters, and there aren t any Republicans exercising real political power over the police or other municipal institutions in Baltimore. Community-organizer   a wretched term   Adam Jackson declared that in Baltimore  the Democrats and the Republicans have both failed.  Really? Which Republicans? Ulysses S. Grant? Unless I m reading the charts wrong, the Baltimore city council is 100 percent Democratic.The other Democratic monopolies aren t looking too hot, either. We re sending Atlanta educators to prison for running a criminal conspiracy to hide the fact that they failed, and failed woefully, to educate the children of that city. Isolated incident? Nope: Atlanta has another cheating scandal across town at the police academy. Who is being poorly served by the fact that Atlanta s school system has been converted into crime syndicate? Mostly poor, mostly black families. Who is likely to suffer from any incompetents advanced through the Atlanta police department by its corrupt academy? Mostly poor, mostly black people. Who suffers most from the incompetence of Baltimore s Democratic mayor? Mostly poor, mostly black families   should they feel better that she s black? Who suffers most from the incompetence and corruption of Baltimore s police department? Mostly poor, mostly black families.And it s the same people who will suffer the most from the vandalism and pillaging going on in Baltimore, too.The evidence suggests very strongly that the left-wing, Democratic claques that run a great many American cities   particularly the poor and black cities   are not capable of running a school system or a police department. They are incompetent, they are corrupt, and they are breathtakingly arrogant. Cleveland, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore   this is what Democrats do.And the kids in the street screaming about  inequality ? Somebody should tell them that the locale in these United States with the least economic inequality is Utah, i.e. the state farthest away from the reach of the people who run Baltimore. Keep voting for the same thing, keep getting the same thing.  Kevin D. Williamson is roving correspondent at National Review.Read more: National Review",1
