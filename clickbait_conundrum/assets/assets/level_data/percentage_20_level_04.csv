62892,"ISIS, Al-Qaeda and the “moderate rebels” are fighting together in Aleppo","shorty Share This: Western claims that the “moderate rebels” fighting the Syrian government are totally separate and antagonistic to ISIS are disproved by the fighting in Aleppo. ALEXANDER MERCOURIS Nothing illustrates the mismatch between Western reporting of the war in Syria and the reality on the ground better than an incident which took place on 1st November 2016 south of Aleppo. The Syrian government’s main supply lines to Aleppo are the roads from the south. This has been especially so since the Jihadi capture of most of the province of Idlib together with its regional capital in the first half of 2015. As the noose tightens on the Jihadis in eastern Aleppo, with their latest counter-offensive repulsed and reports that the eastern districts of the city under Jihadi control are running out of essential fuel and other supplies as the cold weather closes in, the Jihadis attempted on 1st November 2016 to try to turn the tables on the Syrian army by cutting its road links to the south of the city. The Jihadi attempt to do this failed and was quickly repulsed, but in the process it exposed the truth of how the war in Syria is actually being fought. It has become an article of faith in the West that the Jihadi fighters in eastern Aleppo are “moderate rebels” and that Jabhat Al-Nusra (ie. Al-Qaeda) accounts for only a small fraction of them. It is also an article of faith in the West that the Jihadi fighters in eastern Aleppo – including those belonging to Jabhat Al-Nusra – are deadly enemies of ISIS, and have nothing in common with ISIS. It is also continuously claimed in the West that the Syrian army and Russia are only engaging in token fighting against ISIS, and that they are almost exclusively concerned with fighting the “moderate rebels” in Aleppo and elsewhere, who are trying to overthrow the Syrian government. Some Western commentators have gone even further, and have come close to saying that Russia, the Syrian government and ISIS are in de facto alliance with each other, as all three are collectively waging war on the “moderate rebels” who are trying to overthrow the Syrian government rather than fight each other. The Jihadi attempt to cut the Syrian army’s supply lines south of Aleppo which took place on 1st November 2016 shows how completely wrong these claims are. The attack was actually carried out by ISIS. Moreover the attack was clearly coordinated with Jabhat Al-Nusra (ie. with Al-Qaeda) which carried out a similar attack in the same area just days before. As recent events have shown, Jabhat Al-Nusra (ie. Al-Qaeda) is the dominant force in eastern Aleppo , though contrary to Western claims ISIS definitely has a presence there, as confirmed by this 10th October 2016 report by RT’s Murad Gazdiev, which shows Jabhat Al-Nusra and ISIS flags flying together in the city. As our contributor Afra’a Dagher – who is a Syrian writer actually writing for The Duran from Syria – has repeatedly warned, the alphabet soup of differently named Jihadi groups in Syria merely disguises a single continuum of violent Wahhabi Jihadis all committed to the same cause: the overthrow of the Syrian government and the establishment of a sectarian exclusivelyWahhabi Sunni state in its place. Here is how Afra’a Dagher explained the role of ISIS in the Syrian conflict “The “Islamic State” has been designed to attract Takfiri (NB: Wahhabi – AM) fighters from all over the world to join the war against Syria. That way the war to destroy Syria and break the Axis of Resistance is fought with no shortage of fanatical recruits. The war is sponsored and funded by Saudi Arabia, the true factory of Wahhabism, as well as by countries like Qatar and Turkey.” Whilst there undoubtedly are tensions between the senior Al-Qaeda and ISIS political leaderships, these have no practical relevance to the situation on the ground, where fighters from the different groups work continuously to defeat their common enemy, which is the Syrian government and Russia.

28429, An Increasingly Unhinged Bundy Family Begins Preparing For A THIRD Standoff,"Cliven Bundy and his unstable group of family and followers have been refreshingly quiet in recent months in the aftermath of their ill-conceived hijacking of an Oregon wildlife refuge and subsequent arrests. It s hard to  occupy  anything behind bars except, perhaps, a 6 10 slab of concrete. However, Cliven is already jonesing for yet another stand-off   and as his mental state deteriorates, the risk of danger grows.Bundy, currently jailed for his instigation of the previous armed standoff in 2014, has hooked up with crazed anti-Obama right-wing  lawyer  Larry Klayman, who has filed lawsuits against people ranging from Obama to Iran s Supreme Leader to, as the Southern Poverty Law Center points out,  his own mother.  The pair   which a judge ruled couldn t legally work together, but appear to be doing so anyway   have concocted a new lawsuit claiming Sen. Harry Reid and President Obama sent  federal storm-troopers  to attack what they referred to as a gathering of  peaceful cowboys. Peaceful. Cowboys.Other parts of the lawsuit include accusations that Reid wants to sell the land to the Chinese and that the judge in the case should recuse herself because she s Latino.But even more troubling than the frivolous lawsuit is the fact that the Bundy family has made no secret about wanting to kickstart yet another showdown with federal agents. The Bundy family is still illegally grazing their cattle on federal lands, and the Bureau of Land Management is getting pretty fed up with it. Environmental groups are also urging the BLM to act, because Bundy s cattle   often times half-starved and neglected   are destroying the wildlife in what was meant to be protected land.Angie Bundy, wife of the currently locked up Ryan, said her husband and his family being locked up is a conspiracy to make it easier to seize their land. In response, she said she and the family are prepared to face another standoff. She even sees a silver lining in the men being locked up. Putting women and children in danger, she reasoned, would encourage other  patriots  to join the cause. Just like last time, they plan on using children as shields. We re not afraid,  Angie added.  If you have a bunch of women and children standing out there and protesting, it ll probably get more people out. What started as an inane property dispute over one man s right to ignore the law and enrich himself at the expense of the American taxpayer has increasingly become a sad spiral into some of the most toxic right-wing conspiracy theories around. The heavily armed  patriots  that flock to Bundy s side whenever he feels like pointing some guns at federal agents have detached themselves from reality. They quite literally believe they are at war with the United States government, and that means the odds that they react violently has skyrocketed. A third standoff almost guarantees tragedy   and the Bundys are rushing headlong into it.Featured image via David Becker/Getty Images",1
28874,Florida nightclub massacre prompts Rubio to reconsider political future,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, who announced his retirement from the Senate after ending his Republican presidential bid in March, said on Monday he would reconsider his future after being urged to seek re-election in the aftermath of the Orlando nightclub massacre.   The Florida Republican told radio host Hugh Hewitt in an interview that the worst mass shooting in U.S. history “most certainly has impacted my thinking in general, at least, about a lot of things.” But Rubio said he has not considered the rampage from a political perspective. “When it visits your home state, when it impacts a community you know well, it really gives you pause to think a little bit about your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country,” Rubio said. “My family and I will be praying about all this and we’ll see what I need to do next with my life in regards to how I can best serve.”   Hewitt urged Rubio to remain in the Senate, describing the lawmaker who sits on the Senate intelligence and foreign relations committees as one of the “very few people” who know the security issues raised by Sunday’s rampage. News of the interview brought an attack on Rubio’s voting record from Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who referred to the Republican repeatedly as “the junior senator” from Florida.  “How can he speak of running for office again when he voted to let potential terrorists buy assault weapons and explosives?” Reid asked on the floor of the Senate. “That is how he voted. The junior senator voted against every gun safety measure.” Rubio, who is also seen as a potential vice presidential running mate for Republican Donald Trump, announced that he would retire from the Senate and take a break from politics after losing Florida’s presidential primary in March to Trump. Before Sunday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and others had urged him to seek re-election, citing polling data that showed he would win re-election and help Republicans retain their Senate majority. Rubio has backed his friend and fellow Republican, Florida Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera, in Florida’s August primary contest for his Senate seat.    If he were to run for re-election, Rubio would have to decide by a June 24 filing deadline. ",0
23128,Former Trump adviser Page met Russian officials in 2016 Moscow trips,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to President Donald Trump, testified to U.S. lawmakers that he met with a Russian deputy prime minister on two trips to Moscow in 2016 and consulted with senior Trump campaign staff about one visit. In testimony made public on Monday, Page initially said he did not meet with any senior Russian officials during a trip in July 2016 but later said he “briefly” greeted Russian deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich, and saw him again at a dinner in December 2016. When asked if he had a private meeting with Dvorkovich on that second trip, Page replied: “We did - he stopped by a dinner I went to in December with people from the university.” Page also said he let senior members of Trump’s campaign staff know of his trip in July 2016, including then-Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, who is now U.S. attorney general, as well as senior Trump aides Hope Hicks and Corey Lewandowski. Page said he reported back to other campaign officials about the July 2016 trip, saying in one email that he had received “incredible insights and outreach”.  He has for months said the trip was made as a private citizen, not as part of his role with the Trump campaign.  Page was interviewed for seven hours last Thursday by members of the House of Representatives’ Intelligence committee, which is probing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion by Trump campaign officials. Special prosecutor Robert Mueller is leading a criminal investigation into the same issues and last week charged two former Trump campaign advisers, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, with money laundering and other crimes. Page, a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow, has attracted the scrutiny of investigators for his numerous contacts with Russia. His trip to Moscow in July 2016 came after he joined the  Trump campaign and he used it to deliver a pro-Russia speech at a university.  But Page, who declined to have an attorney present during the testimony to the House committee, said his trips to Russia were “benign” and blasted the congressional investigations as a waste of time and money.  Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House’s Intelligence committee, said Page’s testimony showed that his denials of formal meetings with senior Russian officials were inaccurate.  “Perhaps most important, Page — after being presented with an email he sent to his campaign supervisors, and which he did not disclose to the Committee prior to the interview and despite a subpoena from the Committee — detailed his meetings with Russian government officials and others, and said that they provided him with insights and outreach that he was interested in sharing with the campaign,” Schiff said. In his testimony, Page said he has been interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation about Russia and the election four or five times this year. When asked if he had been contacted by Mueller, he said he would rather not discuss it.  ",0
29098, Gretchen Carlson Recorded Roger Ailes’ Sexual Harassment,"The man now advising, coaching, and strategizing with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Roger Ailes, is going to be in a further world of hurt as New York Magazine reports that Gretchen Carlson taped his sexual prowess against her.According to the magazine:Taking on Ailes was dangerous, but Carlson was determined to fight back. She settled on a simple strategy: She would turn the tables on his surveillance. Beginning in 2014, according to a person familiar with the lawsuit, Carlson brought her iPhone to meetings in Ailes s office and secretly recorded him saying the kinds of things he d been saying to her all along.  I think you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago, and then you d be good and better and I d be good and better. Sometimes problems are easier to solve  that way, he said in one conversation.  I m sure you can do sweet nothings when you want to,  he said another time.Now who does this sound like?For over a year Carlson had been taping these instances and now that physical evidence is known to be in existence, will Trump continue to be an apologist for Ailes? Remember that back in July, Trump took Ailes  side and expressed doubt that Carlson was telling the truth, saying,  I can tell you that some of the women that are complaining, I know how much he s helped them, and even recently. In Trump s world, if a woman is given a promotion, a job to begin with, or sustains employment, there is no possible way that her boss can be a total predator. Trump, who paints himself to be the  law and order candidate,  has been taking advice from a man who sexually harassed and coerced female employees for years.This should go over well with female voters, in which Trump has record deficits with.If there s one thing this story can tell us, it s that Ailes and Trump are two peas in the sexist pod. They both are right-wing ideologues who built empires, and they both have an aura of sleaze that surrounds and follows them.I wonder how long it will take Trump to disavow.Featured image via Rich Polk/Getty Images",1
23303,"Trump University Offers Sarah Palin Honorary Degree in Climate Science
","Manhattan  Earlier this morning, Trump University issued degrees to 4,500 students online, and drew the attention of national media when the university announced several high-profile recipients of honorary degrees, sources say. Among those to receive honorary degrees, Sarah Palin was offered a honorary doctorate in climate science, a M.D. in advanced neurosurgery, and a PhD in having total class.

31783,Technology Blackout Feared As Solar Storm Hits Earth,"  Edmondo Burr in Sci/Environment // 0 Comments Yesterday the sun erupted with a huge solar flare sending streams of particles bombarding towards Earth. 
A solar storm can wreak havoc on electricity power lines and technologies that rely on satellites. 
People are warned to prepare for the worst in coming days. 
The Daily Express reports: 
Solar storms can affect technology here on Earth as the radiation thrown at our planet heat the outer atmosphere, resulting in it expanding. 
As a result, satellite communications struggle to penetrate the atmosphere, essentially blocking communications which could lead to a lack of GPS navigation, mobile phone signal and satellite TV such as Sky. 
Furthermore, higher currents in the magnetosphere – the Earth’s magnetic field – could result in a surge of electricity in power lines, which can blow out electrical transformers and power stations leading to a temporary loss of electricity in a region – although this usually only occurs in areas that are in high altitude. 
The solar storm is predicted to carry on until October 27 and officials are telling citizens to prepare for the worst. 
The US Space Weather Prediction Center said: “Voltage corrections may be required, false alarms triggered on some protection devices. 
“Drag may increase on low-Earth-orbit satellites, and corrections may be needed for orientation problems”. 
The storm was originally described as a “serious” G3 level storm, although it was later downgraded to a G2. 
The UK Met Office said: “Elevated solar winds are expected throughout the period, with G1-G2 minor to moderate geomagnetic storms forecast.” Greenland 
However, on the plus side, solar storms can lead to the Northern Lights being visible. 
As the magnetosphere gets bombarded by solar winds, stunning blue lights can appear over the upper reaches of the Northern hemisphere and the lower parts of the southern hemisphere.",1
64925,Trump says not entirely sure he will attend Fox News debate,"(Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said on Monday he was “not 100 percent” certain he would participate in a debate this week co-hosted by Fox News Channel (FOXA.O) because he did not think moderator Megyn Kelly could treat him fairly. Trump told CNN he would probably participate, but added: “I’m not 100 percent; I’ll see. If I think I’m going to be treated unfairly, I’ll do something else. But I don’t think she can treat me fairly, actually, I think she’s very biased. But that doesn’t mean I don’t do the debate.”     Trump added he had won every debate so far. “So I want to do the debates, they’re good for me, but I don’t think she can treat me fairly and I’m not a big fan of hers. Maybe I know too much about her.” Thursday’s debate, also co-hosted by Google (GOOGL.O), is the last one before the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, the first contest in the nomination race for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Later on Monday, Fox News responded to Trump’s remarks in an emailed statement it attributed to a network spokesperson. “Sooner or later Donald Trump, even if he’s president, is going to have to learn that he doesn’t get to pick the journalists - we’re very surprised he’s willing to show that much fear about being questioned by Megyn Kelly.” Following a debate hosted by Fox News last August, the real estate billionaire accused the network and Kelly of asking him tougher questions than those asked of the other candidates. Kelly responded that probing questions were part of her job. Trump also drew criticism at the time for comments that many people interpreted as suggesting that Kelly was affected by hormones during the debate. Trump’s blunt speaking style has boosted ratings for the Republican presidential debates. The August debate on Fox News drew 24 million viewers, a record for a presidential primary debate and the highest non-sports telecast in cable TV history.

Famadihana is also an opportunity to party:The customary ritual, rather than a religious rite, can be shocking for some, but for those taking part, it is an intense celebration accompanied by music, dancing and singing, fuelled by alcoholic drinks.When the party is over, participants store the mats that the bodies are laid on under their own mattresses. This is said to bring good luck.But some doctors warn that they can also transmit germs and infections.And, at a time when Madagascar is enduring its most lethal outbreak of the plague in years, the practice of body turning has raised fears among health officials.Since August, the disease has infected more than 1,100 people, with 124 deaths.  Health ministry epidemiologists have long observed that plague season coincides with the period when famadihana ceremonies are held from July to October.But who cares about the plague?

34216,LIST OF 15 CORPORATIONS Working With Obama To Bring UNLIMITED NUMBER OF REFUGEES To America,"Buckle up America Obama still has 6 months to fundamentally transform America. If the media and #NeverTrump crowd manages to convince voters to support Crooked Hillary, it will be the end of America as we know it Who will be vetting the unlimited number of potential terrorists refugees Obama is bringing to America? The White House announced last week that it is launching a  Call to Action  asking private businesses to help with the resettlement of refugees. This could be done without regard to the government cap of 85,000 total refugees, including 10,000 Syrian refugees, in 2016.Fifteen founding corporations have teamed up with the Obama administration on the effort. These are: Accenture, Airbnb, Chobani, Coursera, Goldman Sachs, Google, HP, IBM, JPMorgan Chase & Co., LinkedIn, Microsoft, Mastercard, UPS, TripAdvisor, and Western Union. The Call to Action initiative is not only to help refugees in the United States, but all over the world.In Europe for example, Mastercard  worked with Mercy Corps to distribute prepaid debit cards to eligible refugees traveling through Serbia. Approximately $75,000 was distributed to nearly 400 families and individuals.  The three main facets of this private partnership program are:  education,   employment,  and  enablement.  Education includes  facilitating refugee children and young adults  education by ensuring that refugee students can access schools of all levels.  The employment facet includes  increasing employment opportunities for refugees. Through those two parts of the initiative refugees can be settled in the United States without limit as they wouldn t fall under the purview of the government cap on refugee resettlement. Through work and education visas refugees would not actually be considered as refugees for their immigration status. One of the companies already partnered with the Obama administration, Chobani, currently has a work force in the United States that is roughly 30 percent resettled refugees. A White House fact sheet states 66 percent of refugees are of working age.Outside of employment and education, under the  enablement  part of the initiative, the White House mentions that companies can help refugees get access to financial services, technology, housing and transport. This also includes  covering costs of charter flight to bring resettled refugees to the United States (or to another country of resettlement). These refugees will be coming outside the refugee resettlement program so they would not be counted under the government cap of 10,000. These  alternative legal pathways or sponsorships  will be under employment visas, training, student visas and scholarships, visiting scholars etc,  Nayla Rush, senior researcher at the Center for Immigration Studies, told The Daily Caller.Rush added,  remember, the aim is to bring as many Syrian refugees as possible. 10,000 is the limit this [Fiscal Year] under the refugee resettlement program. No limit to these  private sponsorships , more importantly, to traceability. At a United Nations summit on September 20, Obama is going to push for  double the number of resettlement slots and alternative legal pathways for admission that are available to refugees, and increase the number of countries accepting significant numbers of refugees.

This is their way of drawing attention to the fact that, as Mashable put it: Donald Trump is really, really obsessed with numbers, especially those that reflect his popularity, sending members of his staff into the world armed with  lies  and  alternative facts  to claim the attendance at his inauguration was HYUGE.

As of the time of this posting, she had well over 18,000 retweets, and more than 37,000 likes.The Stars do tend to be irreverent when it comes to egotistical celebrities and their own opponents. They ve trolled Justin Bieber and Toronto; and they went after the city of Winnipeg, too, where they posted a list of  reasons  to visit Winnipeg that included,  Any suggestions?  and  Go visit Vancouver instead. So this isn t anything new, but it is hilarious given Trump s inauguration and his ego. He s so embarrassed by the size of his inaugural crowd that his press secretary, Sean Spicer, told a a series of outright lies in an attempt to convince us that all evidence to the contrary, no matter how obvious, was fabricated.The Stars actually had a crowd closer to 18,500   there s no sports arena in the U.S. that can hold anything close to 1.5 million people.

26268,Obama orders review of 2016 election cyber attacks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama has ordered intelligence agencies to review cyber attacks and foreign intervention into the 2016 election and deliver a report before he leaves office on Jan. 20, the White House said on Friday. In October, the U.S. government formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election, and Obama has said he warned Russian President Vladimir Putin about consequences for the attacks. The review and its timeline are a signal that Obama wants the issue addressed before he hands power to President-elect Donald Trump, who cast doubt on Russia’s hacking role and praised Putin during the campaign.   Obama’s homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, told reporters the report’s results would be shared with lawmakers and others. “The president has directed the intelligence community to conduct a full review of what happened during the 2016 election process ... and to capture lessons learned from that and to report to a range of stakeholders, to include the Congress,” she said during an event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the review would be a “deep dive” that would look for a pattern of such behavior over several years during election time, dating as far back as the 2008 presidential election.  He noted that Obama wanted the review completed under his watch. “This is a major priority,” Schultz said. During his campaign for the White House, Trump called on Russia to dig up missing emails from his opponent, Hillary Clinton, from her time as secretary of state under Obama, a fellow Democrat. That move prompted critics to accuse him of encouraging foreign actors to conduct espionage. The New York businessman has said he is not convinced Russia was behind the attacks. “I don’t believe they interfered,” Trump told Time magazine about Russia in an interview published this week. “That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say, ‘Oh, Russia interfered.’” People Trump has nominated for top national security posts in his new administration have taken a harsher stance toward Moscow. Russian officials have denied all accusations of interference in the U.S. election. Obama has come under pressure from Democratic lawmakers to declassify more intelligence on the alleged hackings. A government source said the review was sparked in part to respond to those demands as well as to determine how much material related to the subject could be made public. “Given President-elect Trump’s disturbing refusal to listen to our intelligence community and accept that the hacking was orchestrated by the Kremlin, there is an added urgency to the need for a thorough review before President Obama leaves office next month,” Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. Monaco said cyber attacks were not new but might have crossed a “new threshold” this year.  When she was working as a senior Federal Bureau of Investigation official in 2008, she said, the agency alerted the presidential campaigns of then-Senator Obama and Republican Senator John McCain that China had infiltrated their respective systems. “We’ve seen in 2008 and in this last election system malicious cyber activity,” Monaco said. Asked if Trump’s transition team was not concerned enough about Russia’s influence on the election or about other threats to the United States such as infectious disease outbreaks, Monaco said it was too soon to say. She noted that she had not met with her successor because the Trump team had yet to name one. ",0
19803, Sam Bee DISMANTLES The Media For Letting Trump Be The Raging Liar He Absolutely Is (VIDEO),"If you haven t noticed, but you probably have, the news media never calls Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump out on his constant lying.The most recent example of this was during the NBC Commander-in-Chief Forum when Matt Lauer went really hard on Hillary Clinton when it came to demanding answers, and then was ridiculously soft on Trump, even though Trump believes Lauer was too hard on him.Well, one person in particular is absolutely fed up with these media shenanigans and that person is Samantha Bee of TBS s  Full Frontal. Bee said: There s no time to report the facts and what people feel are the facts. You ve got to choose one. Guys, we are swimming in bad information. Our dads are on Facebook. Chemtrails are not real, dad. Adding: Why can t the media just tell us what s true and what s bullsh*t? Bee also points out that many in the media are refusing to call Trump out for lying because then it could appear that they are biased with their own opinion. However, she lays to rest that common misconception when she says: Calling a liar a liar isn t an opinion if you can prove it. That s what we call a fact. The idea that news network executives traded their balls for ratings, that s just my opinion. And as many in the media are trying to make Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton somehow equal when it comes to being qualified, or equally as bad, they are clearly mistaken. Bee lets them have it and does NOT hold back, saying: Maintaining the image of fairness requires them to portray Hillary and Trump as equally flawed candidates, even though they know that s incorrect. On the one hand you have the most breathtakingly, unqualified, ignoramus to of heave his balls within striking distance of office. A race-baiting bully who, according to two meticulously researched biographies, is a tax cheating, investor swindling, worker- shafting, dictator-loving, pathologically lying, attorneys general bribing, philandering, mobbed up, narcissistic serial con artist who hasn t got the attention span to read a fortune cookie much less a f*cking intelligence briefing. Adding: But on the other hand, Hillary used a private email server. See? Perfectly even. BOOM!Yeah, not exactly even. Trump is the LAST thing we need for this nation in general, let alone as Commander-in-Chief.Well f*cking done, Sam.Watch Same Bee tear the media a new one here:Featured image via video screen capture, HT C&L",1
48332,We Are the Disclosure – proving disclosure to be the most important topic of our time [VIDEO],"The Moore Show Published on Oct 16, 2016 Since the late 1940s, a growing number of individuals and groups have sought public disclosure of what the authorities know about interaction between humans and non-human intelligences. But for 70 years the authorities have employed a policy of secrecy, denial and ridicule to keep the subject convert. Thus the responsibility of reporting and analyzing these contact phenomena has fallen to those called in various ways to participate. We Are the Disclosure is an embodiment of the bottom-up Disclosure process that has been underway for seven decades. Through in-depth interviews, it provides a people’s history of the development of the field since the early days, and brings it up to date. Leading researchers in the field are joined by archeologists, radio hosts, a remote viewer, those engaging in direct ET contact, and several ET-human hybrids. This broad-ranging survey of the growth of this field, and our awareness of its meaning, is discussed in Part I of We Are the Disclosure by Alexis Brooks, Lyn Buchanan, Michael Cremo, Klaus Dona, Stanton Friedman, Robert Fullington, Marilyn Gewacke, Rey Hernandez, Gary Heseltine, C. B. Scott Jones, Jujuolui Kuita, Barbara Lamb, Vanessa Lamorte and Joanne Summerscales. This book provides strong evidence that Disclosure may prove to be the most important topic of our time, and that it is being driven in large part by the ETs themselves. Coast to coast AM 2016",1
16921,EPA Jails 185 Americans For ‘Environmental Crimes’ But No One For Massive EPA Toxic Spill,"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforcers helped convict 185 Americans of environmental crimes this year, with each of these eco-convicts getting sentenced to eight months in prison on average for crimes ranging from biofuel fraud to illegally removing asbestos. Every year, EPA agents help put dozens of Americans in prison for breaking U.S. environmental laws. Environmental crimes range from spilling coal ash into public waterways, to pretending to produce biofuels, to illegally cleaning up asbestos in buildings.Interestingly enough, EPA has not fined or jailed anyone for the spilling of three million gallons of mine wastewater in August. That month, EPA workers opened up the Gold King Mine and sent a toxic plume of mine waste though rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. Toxic mine waste even went through Navajo Nation territory and resulted in farms having their water supplies shut off.Republican lawmakers were quick to criticize EPA for not taking any disciplinary action against contractors or employees involved in the Colorado mine spill. Lawmakers noted that while EPA drags its feet, a private company, like Duke, would have been fined quickly if it had spilled mine waste.The Department of the Interior s outside review of the spill incident found EPA could have avoided a blowout if it had taken precautions agency workers had used while opening other sealed Colorado mines.Interior found that had the agency used  a drill rig to bore into the mine from above  to open Gold King  the mine would have been revised, and the blowout would not have occurred. The EPA has taken responsibility for the spill, but still hasn t taken actions against agency workers who opened up the mine mouth. In fact, lawmakers are worried the agency is trying to taint a federal investigation into the spill.Read more: Daily Caller",1
25124," ‘Go F*ck Yourselves’: Larry Wilmore SLAMS Ted Cruz, Fox News Over Anti-Muslim Rhetoric (VIDEO)","The terror attacks in Brussels, Belgium have brought out the Muslim-haters on the right in full force   particularly GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz. The creepiest candidate on the right has openly called for the police to increase patrols in  Muslim neighborhoods,  and has gotten backing for his disgusting statements from the network that is a longtime mouthpiece of the bigoted right   Fox News.Well, there s one person who isn t taking their bullshit lying down: Comedy Central host Larry Wilmore. On Wednesday night s edition of his show, Wilmore blasted Cruz and Fox over their bigotry, and especially their insistence that anyone questioning their hateful words is just being  politically correct. Gooooooooo f*ck yourselves.   I mean, a major news network, so-called major news network, and a major presidential candidate slamming a major religion has nothing to do with political correctness. It s just wrong. To round out the hilarious   but truthful   segment, Wilmore interviewed Masir Ali, an expert on the Middle East. He weighed in from a snowy vacation, complete with snowboard, to show everyone just how dumb Ted Cruz and Fox News really are.The Nightly Show host is right. They are wrong. Bigotry and discrimination are a huge and major selling point with right-wingers, and here in the year 2016 that is just shameful. We seriously have one of the two major political parties in America that gets most of their votes for hating on anyone who isn t straight, white, male, and Christian. Think about that, and what it means for the future of this country.Watch the video below via Comedy Central:Featured image via video screen capture",1
