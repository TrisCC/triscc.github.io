20455,Highest glass ceiling remains intact after Clinton's stunning loss,"(Reuters) - They wore pantsuits to their polling places, emulating the preferred dress of their White House candidate. Some wept with emotion and others remembered their female ancestors as they cast their vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton. But rather than witness the shattering of the ultimate glass ceiling, women across America watched an historic breakthrough slip away as Clinton failed to become the first woman elected president of the United States. Republican Donald Trump, who had waged a heated campaign painting the former secretary of state as  “crooked” and threatening to put her in jail, swept to surprise victory on an anti-establishment platform. “I was looking forward to having a woman president. I really was. I can’t believe people voted for that terrible man,” said Mariana Mejia, 61, sitting at a subdued party at California Democratic Party headquarters in Sacramento. Some women defied their own political tradition to vote for the first woman presidential nominee of a major U.S. political party. Republican Cassandra Pye, a pioneering African-American political consultant who advised former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, said she felt the pull of history as she cast her ballot for Clinton. “I feel like even though I vote in the booth alone, there are always people in there with me,” Pye said. “My ancestors, my mother, my aunties - there were a lot of people in the booth with me today.” A polarizing figure with a long history in the public eye, Clinton entered the White House as first lady in 1993, after her husband, Bill Clinton, defeated incumbent George H. W. Bush. Her ambition immediately clashed with the public’s image of a first lady, and Clinton won enemies as swiftly as she earned the adoration of many progressive women. When she lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama in 2008, Clinton conceded that “although we weren’t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it’s got about 18 million cracks in it,” referring to the number of votes she had won.  Women who had pinned their hopes on Clinton gave a nod to their political history on Tuesday, forming a long line to leave “I Voted Today” stickers on the gravestone of women’s suffrage activist Susan B. Anthony.  Others, dressed in white like the suffragettes who campaigned for a woman’s right to vote and wearing pantsuits like those favored by Clinton, posed for photos at state Capitol buildings and other iconic locations. Several bemoaned the fact that U.S. women won the right to vote in 1920 and nearly a century later the country has yet to elect a woman president.         “It’s been such a hard struggle for women, a very hard struggle,” said U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer, who in 1992 made history along with Senator Dianne Feinstein as the first women elected from California to the U.S. Senate. “It’s a very emotional moment.” Trump, a wealthy real estate developer and former reality TV star, defied political correctness with comments that angered women, minorities and the disabled. He denied allegations by several women that he groped them after the emergence of a video where he boasted about making unwanted sexual advances on women.    At the Sacramento Democratic party gathering, some women lamented his victory and the long, difficult trek for women to win positions of power.  “I thought by the time I hit 61 it would be different for women and minorities,” said Chris Cage, 61, a former journalist and labor organizer. “I see a victory for Trump as a vote against both.” ",0
51699,‘Last Night in Sweden’? Trump’s Remark Baffles a Nation - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   Swedes reacted with confusion, anger and ridicule on Sunday to a vague remark by President Trump that suggested that something terrible had occurred in their country. During a   rally on Saturday in Florida, Mr. Trump issued a sharp if discursive attack on refugee policies in Europe, ticking off a list of places that have been hit by terrorists. “You look at what’s happening,” he told his supporters. “We’ve got to keep our country safe. You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?” Not the Swedes. Nothing particularly nefarious happened in Sweden on Friday  —   or Saturday, for that matter  —   and Swedes were left baffled. “Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound,” Carl Bildt, a former prime minister and foreign minister, wrote on Twitter. As the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet noted, Twitter users were quick to ridicule Mr. Trump’s remark, with joking references to the Swedish Chef, the “Muppets” character Swedish meatballs and Ikea, the furniture giant. Mr. Trump did not state, per se, that a terrorist attack had taken place in Sweden. But the context of his remarks  —   he mentioned Sweden right after he chastised Germany, a destination for refugees and asylum seekers fleeing war and deprivation  —   suggested that he thought it might have. “Sweden,” Mr. Trump said. “They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible. ” He then invoked the terrorist attacks that took place in Paris in 2015 and in Brussels and Nice, France, last year, to make an argument for tightening scrutiny of travelers and asylum seekers. “We’ve allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country, and there was no way to vet those people,” he said. “There was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we’re going to keep our country safe. ” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, tried to clarify the president’s remarks Sunday, saying Mr. Trump did not mean to suggest that a particular attack had happened the night before, but rather was talking about crime in general in Sweden. On Sunday, Mr. Trump offered his own clarification, writing on Twitter, “My statement as to what’s happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants  Sweden. ” In that story, the Fox News host Tucker Carlson interviewed Ami Horowitz, a filmmaker who asserts that migrants in Sweden have been associated with a crime wave. “They oftentimes try to cover up some of these crimes,” Mr. Horowitz said, arguing that those who try to tell the truth about the situation are shouted down as racists and xenophobes. (Mr. Carlson interjected, “The masochism of the West knows no bounds at all. ”) Mr. Horowitz said, “Sweden had its first terrorist Islamic attack not that long ago, so they’re now getting a taste of what we’ve been seeing across Europe already. ” It was not clear what he was referring to. In 2010, a suicide bomber struck central Stockholm, injuring two people. The bomber, Taimour Abdulwahab   28, was an   Swede who had developed an affinity for Al Qaeda. But that attack occurred long before the current wave of migrants. Sweden has a long history of welcoming refugees  —   Jews, Iranians, Eritreans, Somalis, Kurds and people from the former Yugoslavia, among others  —   but even some of the most tolerant and idealistic Swedes have raised questions about whether the country can absorb so many newcomers so quickly. Henrik Selin, a political scientist and deputy director of the Swedish Institute, a state agency dedicated to promoting Sweden globally, said he was puzzled by Mr. Trump’s remarks. “I do not have a clue what he was referring to,” he said in a telephone interview. “Obviously, this could be connected to the fact that there has been a lot of negative reporting about Sweden, since Sweden has taken in a lot of refugees. ” The country processed 81, 000 asylum seekers in 2014, 163, 000 in 2015 and 29, 000 last year, with another 25, 000 to 45, 000 expected this year, according to the Swedish Migration Agency. Mr. Selin completed a study recently focusing on negative news reports about Sweden’s acceptance of refugees. It found numerous exaggerations and distortions, including false reports that Shariah law was predominant in parts of the country and that some   neighborhoods were considered “  zones” by the police. Breitbart News, the   website once led by Stephen K. Bannon, now Mr. Trump’s senior strategist, has published numerous stories alleging that migrants have been responsible for a surge in crime and for a wave of sexual assaults. Swedish officials have said that their statistics do not justify such sweeping assertions, and that the country has a high number of sexual assault reports relative to other European countries because more victims come forward, not because there is more violence. Mr. Selin said the news reports “were highly exaggerated and not based in facts,” adding, “Some of the stories were very popular to spread in social media by people who have the same kind of agenda  —   that countries should not receive so many refugees. ” As for the   alleged by Mr. Horowitz, Mr. Selin said: “That kind of claim has been in the political debate for 15 years now. But nobody has been able to prove there is a  . On the contrary, the fact is that crime rates are going down. ” He added: “Swedish authorities have nothing to gain from hiding the truth. We are quite keen to ensure that the debate and the story about our country is   and nuanced. We are more than happy to talk about the challenges our country faces as well as the things that are going well. ” Asked about Mr. Trump’s comment, Anna Kinberg Batra, the leader of the opposition Moderate Party, said in a statement, “President Trump has to answer himself for his statements, why he makes them and based on what facts. ” Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom declined to comment because, her press secretary, Erik Wirkensjo, said, “it’s hard to say what Trump is talking about. ” In an essay in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter, the journalist Martin Gelin speculated that “Trump might have gotten his news from the countless   media in the United States that have long been reporting that Sweden is heading for total collapse. ” He added, “Among Trump supporters, there are common myths that Sweden is in a state of chaos after taking in refugees from the Middle East. ”",0

12201,Emotional Service Held At Charleston Church Days After Shootings,"The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., today is holding its first Sunday service following a horrific shooting that killed nine members of a Bible study group there.

Dylann Roof, 21 — who has apparently expressed strong racist and white supremacist views — is charged in the Wednesday night killings, in which nine members of a Bible study group at the historic black church were shot dead. Emanuel AME's pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pickney, was among those killed.

As parishioners and visitors fanned themselves against the heat of the first day of summer, the service opened at 9:30 a.m. EDT to filled pews. Hundreds more gathered outside the church.

The service opened with the hymns ""Praise God, From Whom All Blessings Flow"" and ""Blessed Assurance.""

The Rev. Norvel Goff said: ""we still believe prayer changes things. ... prayer not only changes things, it changes us.""

""Many hearts are broken and tears being shed,"" he said. ""Through it all we are reminded that we serve a God who still cares.""

Delivering the sermon later, he acknowledged ""it has been tough. It has been rough. Some of us have been downright angry.""

But, he said, ""We have shown the world how we as a group of people can come together and pray and work out things that need to be worked out, to make a better state and place to live.""

He thanked Gov. Nikki Haley for making sure ""the perpetrator that committed that heinous act was pursued and captured and brought back to South Carolina.""

He also thanked Charleston Mayor Joseph Ripley and law enforcement.

""I have no problem with doing it,"" he said to loud applause.

""We have difficulties ahead, but the only way evil can triumph is for good folks to sit down and do nothing,"" he said.

Earlier, the Rev. John H. Gillison prayed that ""in life there are ups and downs. There are dark days, but there are also bright days.""

He called on God to ""guide and strengthen those families who were victimized,"" and referring to Wednesday's tragedy said ""the devil tried to take charge.""

""But the devil cannot take control of your people and cannot take control of your church,"" Gillison said.

NPR's Debbie Elliott, reporting from the church, says: ""It's a very emotional day for the city of Charleston. People are gathering, bringing flowers, weeping, praying, and preparing for this very difficult morning.""

Debbie adds: ""This is all happening at the same time that police officers and their dogs are doing searches of the parking lot and preparing the church to be a safe place for people to come and remember this morning.""

The Rev. Randolph Miller, pastor of Nichols Chapel AME Church in Charleston, tells CNN: ""We must continue to preach [forgiveness] and drive it home. It won't happen overnight, but we must not stop preaching forgiveness.""

""Hopefully one day it will sink in and bring a change,"" he said.",0
2321,"Bashing Trump not enough for Democrats to win Latino vote, advocates warn","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Latino groups have criticized the Democratic Party for relying too heavily on Republican Donald Trump’s inflammatory comments on illegal immigration to drive Hispanic voters to the polls, calling instead for the party to do more to address Latino concerns, according to meeting notes seen by Reuters. “(W)e cannot rely on Trump as that will set us up for failure,” according to notes summarizing a meeting on May 2 between Democratic Party officials and representatives of several Hispanic advocacy groups. “Our values… need to be uplifted,” they continued. Hispanics make up around 17 percent of the U.S. population, making them a critical voter group in what is expected to be a tight race between Trump and the Democratic nominee.  Democratic operatives have called Trump an ideal spur for getting out the Latino vote because of his hard-line approach to illegal immigration, with some canvassers even using his picture to help encourage Hispanics to register..  The New York billionaire and now presumptive Republican nominee made waves early in his campaign by saying Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers over the border. He has vowed to make Mexico pay for building a wall to block them and promised to round up and deport the millions of undocumented immigrants now in the United States. By contrast, Democratic contenders for the White House, front-runner Hillary Clinton and rival U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have both promised to provide undocumented immigrants a path to legal status. The have also promised to nominate Latinos to key posts in their prospective administrations. At least two Hispanics are also considered candidates to be the running mate to the eventual Democratic presidential nominee: Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro.   “While Latinos appear to be a solid part of the Democratic base right now, that can certainly change,” said Brent Wilkes, the treasurer for the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda and the national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, who was present at the meeting.  In the last election in 2012, Latinos constituted 10 percent of the electorate and voted for President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney by 71 percent to 27 percent, according to an analysis of exit polls by the Pew Hispanic Center. Many Latino advocates also stressed to the Democratic Party that, as members of nonpartisan organizations, their concerns are in addressing issues within their communities, such as education and the economy, rather than backing any one party or candidate. The Democratic delegation at the meeting, which according to the notes included the new Hispanic outreach director, Bridgette Gomez, assured the advocates their Latino outreach strategy was not merely Trump-focused, one participant said.  “Donald Trump’s candidacy fits into a much longer term and more thoughtful approach than just one election cycle,” Democratic National Committee spokesman Pablo Manriquez said on Friday. He added that the party is focused on broader issues such as voting rights and the concerns of Latino families for this election and beyond.    Participants at the meeting also told the party they didn’t see enough Latinos in the pipeline for future leadership positions, including elected office around the country, according to the meeting notes. “It’s not just infrastructure for political participation, but how to get people to run for office, how to teach people to run their own campaigns,” said Maria Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino, which had a representative at the meeting.

50635,"After Losing a Foster Child, Contemplating Another - The New York Times","He’s sitting on a couch with his brothers, presumably in the home in which he’s now growing up. The photo has a graininess to it that is reminiscent of photos from the 1980s, but this picture is much more recent than that. It’s the first visual I’ve had of my former foster son since I hugged him goodbye. The boy we nicknamed “BlueJay” lived with us for almost a year when extended family members stepped forward to take custody of him and his two brothers back in March. In the series Foster Parent Diary, I wrote about the experience of loving and losing him. Now, I zoom in and out of this photo, studying every blurry detail. I know he was 4 years old when the photo was taken, the same age he was when he left our home, but he looks so much older. I can see how his legs are longer, his shoulders broader. His biological mother sent me the picture. She and I have remained in contact since he left. As far as I know, it is the only photo she has received since her son went to live in a home several hours away from her. The updates she gets and passes along to me are sporadic and superficial. I’m not sure even she really knows how he is doing. I dream about him. In my dreams, he’s always a little bit older with slightly more chiseled features. Sometimes he remembers me, sometimes he doesn’t. Sometimes he runs into my arms, sometimes he runs from them. On the days when he remembers me, when I pull him in for a tight hug and he asks me where I’ve been, it feels so real that I wake up with an irrational hope that he had the same dream, too. That maybe we’d found a way to cross the distance between us, just for a moment. My son, Ryan, who is now 6 years old, recently asked me if we could call his former foster brother one day to talk to him, to tell him we miss him. “I’m sorry, buddy, we can’t,” I said. “But why?” But why. It is the central question I have struggled with over the past 10 months. Why couldn’t we stay in his life? Why couldn’t we send him a new outfit for school or call him to wish him a happy birthday when he recently turned 5? Why couldn’t we continue to offer him our love from afar? We couldn’t because his relatives didn’t want us to. They didn’t see the point of it, the value in it. They wanted a clean break. A lot of time has passed since our foster son left. We talk about him more with smiles now than with tears. We’ve given ourselves the time and space needed to figure out whether the hole in our lives is one that only he was meant to fill or whether our family is still incomplete. Finally, we are starting to feel ready. My husband, Mike, and I are preparing, once again, for foster care adoption. We’re being more cautious and more deliberate this time. This time, we are moving slowly. This time, we are more educated and less exuberant. We are setting new parameters. We will consider only children who are legally free for adoption or as close to it as possible. We will not be called one day and asked to pick up a child in need of an immediate, temporary home. This time, we will be matched with a child who may have been waiting for a permanent family for as long as we’ve been waiting to complete ours. Realistically, that probably means a child Ryan’s age or older. There will be fliers with pictures and stacks of files and the child’s own opinions to consider. Caring for a child for almost a year and then being given less than 24 hours to pack him up and say a permanent goodbye changes a person. It strips you of your naïveté. It inflicts a sense of loss that cuts deep. It can harden you with cynicism, sadness and fear, if you let it. Our former foster son looks different in the photo. He is not smiling. He’s staring into the camera with a blank look I don’t recognize on him. He doesn’t look like the happy, spunky little boy I knew. He looks more like how I felt for months after he left: Dazed. The longer I stare at the photo, the more I wish I’d never seen it. Then again, it’s just one picture. One moment out of a billion moments in his lifetime. How could one picture be a fair representation of his current life? Maybe he was tired or bored or cranky when it was taken. Maybe, overall, things are going great for him. Do I have a real reason to believe otherwise? All I have is one picture. We can choose the cynicism, the sadness and the fear, or we can choose hope. We can shrivel up into a hardened ball, or we can pick ourselves up, dust off our arms, shake out our hair and press forward. We can acknowledge our own heartache for what it was: The inevitable result of fully loving a child who was never really ours. There was no mistake in that. We can let go of our worry and instead, believe in him. Believe that he’s strong enough to overcome the hardships of his early life, strong enough to thrive. We can allow ourselves to hope the final piece of our family’s puzzle is still out there. We can close our eyes, take a deep breath, center ourselves. And then we can go in search of that piece.",0
9555, Liberals Brilliantly Troll The GOP With A Petition To Make Their Convention An ‘Open Carry Event’,"Every time a school shooting happens, the idiots on the right yank out the memes and propaganda declaring that the school being a  gun free zone  is why it was chosen. They call the shooter a  lone wolf  or  mentally ill  and point out this his sister s college roommate was a Democrat. The gun had nothing to do with it, and had there been more guns in the school it wouldn t have gone down how it did.On that one they are correct. Most experts agree that if you put more guns in a dangerous situation, especially where people are running and panicking, you re going to end up with a deadly crossfire and more people will die senselessly. Still, the NRA-controlled Republican party stands by their platform of more guns for everyone, no matter who, in every situation, no matter what. Going out for breakfast? Bring your gun; a criminal (who has every right to a gun) might be there with a gun. Headed to the movies? Arm yourself. Some mentally ill guy with a gun (who has every right to carry it) may be there looking to calm the voices in his head.Guns, guns, guns. With more than 300 million instruments of death in circulation, not including the homemade versions, the likelihood that we ll ever see an end to the senseless violence is pretty slim. All we can do is point out the stupidity, abhor the violence and mock the hypocrisy when we see it happening around us. That s exactly what one anonymous liberal did when he or she wrote and uploaded a petition to change.org.The Republican National Convention, you see, is being held at the Quicken Loans Arena, which is a  gun free zone.  What better way to make them eat their own stupid words than at their official clown convention. The petition, a masterpiece of leftist trollery, takes aim at the Party, its leaders and base by calling for the following five points of action:1. From the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland: A suspension of their policy preventing the open carry of firearms on the premises of the arena from July 18-21, 2016 to coincide with the Republican National Convention.2. From the National Rifle Association: An immediate condemnation of the egregious affront to the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution constituted by the  gun-free zone  loophole to the state law.3. From Ohio Governor John Kasich: A concerted effort to use his executive authority to override the  gun-free zone  loophole being exploited by the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.4. From Reince Priebus and the Republican National Committee: An explanation of how a venue so unfriendly to Second Amendment rights was chosen for the Republican Convention. Further, we demand a contingency plan to relocate the convention to another location should the Quicken Loans Arena refuse to honor the constitutional rights of the RNC guests to open carry firearms during the convention.5. From all Republican candidates for President: You have been brave in raising awareness about the immense dangers posed by  gun-free zones.  In order to ensure the safety of your supporters, delegates and all attendees at the convention in July, you must call upon the RNC to rectify this affront to our Second Amendment freedoms and insist upon a suspension of the Quicken Loans Arena s unconstitutional  gun-free zone  loophole. Every American is endowed with a God-given Constitutional right to carry a gun wherever and whenever they please.The best part about this masterpiece is that some right-wing extremist social media pages have begun to catch on and post support for it, because yes, they are that stupid. You can read and sign the petition HERE. The comments are priceless, too. Enjoy!Featured image from The Cleveland Patch",1
39551,Donald Trump can’t stop saying nasty things about women. It could cost him.,"A nasty feud that escalated Thursday between Donald Trump and his chief Republican rival over their wives set off a new wave of alarm among establishment Republicans, who fear that the GOP front-runner would drive away female voters in a general-election fight with likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Trump’s gender problem flared again this week as he and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas traded insults while Cruz’s wife, Heidi, became the target of vitriol on social media from Trump and his supporters. At one point, the real estate mogul retweeted an unflattering image contrasting Heidi Cruz’s appearance with his wife, Melania, a retired model.

“The images are worth a thousand words,” read the caption on the photo that Trump retweeted to his 7.2 million followers.

That message and others have prompted an outcry among Republicans and Democrats alike, while Cruz said Thursday that “real men don’t bully women.”

“Our spouses and our children are off-bounds,” Cruz told reporters while campaigning in Dane, Wis. “It is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife. It is not acceptable for him to make insults, to send nasty tweets.”

The altercation underscores the striking nastiness of the GOP primary race and the uncomfortable gender politics surrounding Trump, who has a long history of making incendiary remarks about women and their appearance. Trump has shown little reluctance in attacking his female rivals — or some of his rivals’ spouses — in ways that strike many as sexist or demeaning, and many fear that the insults are a harbinger of the gutter rhetoric to come if he faces Clinton in November.

Trump has called Clinton “very shrill,” belittles her for a lack of stamina and energy, and late last year jabbed her and husband, Bill Clinton, for the latter’s marital indiscretions while he was president. In another instance, Trump said Hillary Clinton “got schlonged” in her 2008 primary fight against then-Sen. Barack Obama.

“I have some very real concerns should he become the nominee. I think it would be catastrophic for our party,” said GOP strategist Katie Packer, who leads the Our Principles PAC, an anti-Trump super PAC. “Half of the reason why I’m fighting so hard to stop Donald Trump is because I think he’s a walking, talking stereotype of a sexist misogynistic pig.”

Polling shows Trump sliding among women in recent months, hurting the GOP’s already shaky position with that demographic. Trump’s favorability numbers have decreased 10 points among women nationwide since November, to 23 percent, while his unfavorable number among women has jumped to 75 percent from 64 percent, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll taken this month.

The changes among men have been less pronounced, with 37 percent now favorable and 59 percent unfavorable. In the states that have voted so far, Trump received an average of 41 percent of the male vote and 34 percent of the female vote.

The fight with Cruz began earlier this week when Make America Awesome, an anti-Trump super PAC, circulated ads on Facebook featuring a risque photograph of Melania Trump from a 15-year-old British GQ photo shoot. It was part of a concerted push to diminish the billionaire among values voters in Utah.

[The GOP — and its big funders — scramble to insulate Congress from Trump]

“Meet Melania Trump. Your next first lady. Or, you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday,” the ad read.

Trump, who went on to lose the Utah caucuses, excoriated Cruz and issued a threat via Twitter: “Be careful, Lyin’ Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!”

Trump — who wrongly alleges that Cruz was behind the ad — defended the tweet Wednesday on Fox Business Network, saying it was a “disgraceful” and “terrible thing” that demeaned his wife, “a very, very successful model.”

Then came Wednesday night, when Trump retweeted the unflattering image of Heidi Cruz, setting off a fresh series of condemnations.

To Trump’s critics, the attacks on Cruz are just the latest in a troubling pattern of reducing women to their physical appearance and disparaging them in exceptionally personal ways.

Exhibit A is the long-running on-again, off-again feud with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, whom Trump called “crazy” and “average in so many ways” in a series of tweets last week. Fox News said the name-calling is part of a “sick obsession” that “is beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate.”

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a former presidential candidate and an outspoken critic of Trump, said Thursday on MSNBC, “I’m worried that young women think that the standard-bearer of the Republican Party believes that Megyn Kelly is a bimbo.”

GOP strategists fear that Trump clinching the nomination could present an opportunity for Democrats, who are poised to choose the first female presidential nominee and who in past elections have accused Republicans of waging a “war on women” over access to affordable women’s health care, abortion rights and pay equity.

Trump’s treatment and views of women have been a central issue throughout his presidential campaign. At the first GOP debate, in August, Trump berated Kelly for asking him about past insults of women and singled out actress Rosie O’Donnell as the specific woman he referred to as a “fat pig.” A month later, Trump criticized the appearance of rival Carly Fiorina, the only woman who sought the GOP nomination. “Look at that face,” he told Rolling Stone magazine. “Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?”

Marcy Stech, communications director at Emily’s List, which has endorsed Clinton, said “the Republican base might find this amusing, but the reality is that these are just the kinds of misogynistic and outrageous comments that will cause lasting damage with women voters.”

She added: “We’ll have plenty of opportunities to remind women voters of this moment even after today’s news cycle has blown over.”

Packer said Trump’s standing with female voters could also endanger the GOP’s hold on the Senate or even the House. At the same time, Packer said, she thinks the anti-Trump movement could prevent the party from being branded by Trump alone.

“Hillary Clinton is very, very vulnerable among this group of women that she needs to have as her base: independent women, and soft Republican women. She’s very vulnerable with them today,” Packer said. “Should we nominate Donald Trump, they will flock to her because they see him as someone who’s repulsive. And it’s not just about so-called ‘women’s issues,’ it’s about how he values women and about how he’s willing to make women feel to benefit himself.”

For months Trump has defended himself against accusations of being offensive to women, saying that he hits all his challengers equally. He labeled former Florida governor Jeb Bush “low energy” and sought to diminish Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida with the nickname “Little Marco.”

“I’d hit you the same way,” Trump told NBC’s Chuck Todd in February when pressed on the issue. “I mean, you are the perfect one to ask that question — you have been, you know, under fire from me for a long time, and you are far from a woman.”

“I think there are some women — there’s one sitting right over there in the beautiful red dress. You see that woman over there? I have great respect for that woman over there,” he said, as Todd clarified to viewers that Trump was talking about veteran reporter Andrea Mitchell.

“I have great respect for that woman,” he said. “And I don’t know that she knows I’m talking about her. I’m talking about you. I would never do that to you.”

30030,Oil prices could fall further if Iran nuclear deal is reached,"Two of the biggest news stories of 2015 have been the fall in global oil prices and the apparent breakthrough in negotiations between Iran, the United States, and others around Iran's nuclear weapons research. And because Iran relies so heavily on oil exports to earn income, the two stories are deeply interlinked.

On the one hand, the decline in the world oil price has made life harder for Iran. On the other hand, relaxing the sanctions against Iran could drive down global oil prices even further — a boon to most of the world's economies, including those of most of the countries pressuring Iran to disarm.

In terms of oil sitting in the ground, Iran is a whale, with almost 10 percent of the world's proven reserves. But in terms of actual oil production, the country has become more of a minnow. That reflects the multifaceted impact of international sanctions on the Iranian industry. Most of all, the financial sanctions have made it extremely difficult for Iran to attract the foreign investment needed to actually pump the oil out of the ground.

More recently, other sanctions on Iranian shipping and direct bans on the importation of Iranian crude oil have further squeezed the industry. In January, Iran's oil minister told a local newspaper that exports had fallen 60 percent since their peak in 2011 to about 1 million barrels per day.

If sanctions were lifted, this trend would turn around as new investment poured into the Iranian industry. Of course, it would take some time for investment to lead to production, and most likely any deal would only provide partial sanctions relief. But the reality that this shadow production could come back online is hanging over global oil markets.

Beyond oil sitting untapped in Iranian soils, there is a surprisingly large quantity of oil that has been pumped and is simply sitting around in storage containers. As Anjli Raval of the Financial Times reported earlier this month, the main cause is a quiet diplomatic triumph of the Obama administration: ""Ahead of Barack Obama’s visit to New Delhi in January, the Indian government asked domestic refiners to slash purchases of Iranian oil and keep imports in line with the previous fiscal year’s levels."" This means oil the Iranians have been pumping for the Indian market has been cooling its heels in storage instead.

Back in late 2014, India was importing 348,000 barrels of Iranian oil per day, which it is allowed to do under the current international sanctions regime. That has fallen to around 50,000 barrels per day as a favor to the anti-Iranian coalition — a favor that is likely tolerable for India because the global trend toward cheap oil makes Iranian imports less desirable.

This and other export curbs mean that for a while now, Iranian exports have actually dropped even more rapidly than Iranian production. The country has responded by investing massively in oil storage. Raval, citing data from the British tanker company Gibson's, says Iran has about 37 million barrels in storage. Unlike oil that's sitting in the ground, oil stored in tankers really could explode onto world markets very quickly in the wake of any kind of diplomatic sentiment. Even if formal sanctions were released only gradually, for example, it is very unlikely that India and other countries would keep up informal deals to swear off Iranian crude.

Negotiations with Iran are being undertaken with an overwhelming emphasis on foreign policy and national security issues. But it is worth mentioning that getting Iranian oil back onto world markets and driving down prices would be excellent news for the American economy.

And it would be even better news for the economies of other key participants in the negotiations — especially Germany and China — that lack America's domestic oil industry.

Conversely, Russia, which has traditionally been one of the countries that is friendliest to Iran, would suffer further economic harm from an influx of Iranian oil. And the Persian Gulf states — led by Saudi Arabia — have generally taken a strong anti-Iranian line in geopolitics and have a strong economic interest in keeping Iranian oil off the market.",0
24416,White House to States: Shield the Undocumented and Lose Police Funding - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Trump administration, signaling its intent to toughen enforcement of immigration laws across the country, threatened on Monday to withhold or revoke law enforcement funding from states, cities and localities that block the police or sheriffs from telling federal authorities about undocumented immigrants in their custody. In an announcement at the White House, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said state and local governments seeking certain law enforcement grants would have to certify that they were complying with a law that bars any official from withholding information from the Department of Homeland Security about a person’s immigration status. Those that are violating the policy could see such grants clawed back, he said. Mr. Sessions’s appearance was an effort to threaten painful consequences for   sanctuary cities, those that decline to cooperate with the federal government in efforts to track and deport undocumented immigrants. “I strongly urge our nation’s states and cities and counties to consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to enforce our immigration laws and to rethink these policies,” Mr. Sessions said. “Such policies make their cities and states less safe  —   public safety as well as national security are at stake  —   and put them at risk of losing federal dollars. ” Mr. Sessions suggested the policy would apply to a total of $4. 1 billion this year in various grants administered by the department. Still, Mr. Sessions did not announce any new policy on Monday. His announcement appeared to be essentially a reiteration or reminder of the status quo. Last July, the Department of Justice under the Obama administration announced a policy of conditioning federal grants on compliance with a 1996 federal statute. The statute forbids imposing restrictions on the ability of the local police or sheriffs to exchange information with federal immigration authorities about the citizenship or immigration status of prisoners in their custody. While the law does not require local law enforcement officials to turn over that information, it is aimed at discouraging efforts by cities or states to block such talks. The   announcement said it would give cities that were not in compliance with the law a reasonable period to adjust their policies, and it is not clear whether any grants have yet been blocked as a result. July’s policy change came after a May report by the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General that looked at the 1996 statute through the lens of local ordinances and rules in 10 major cities, finding that many limited the information local authorities could provide to federal immigration agents. For example, the report cites a 2014 law in New York City that restricts the corrections department from telling Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials about an inmate’s release date, incarceration status or coming court dates unless the inmate was the subject of a detainer request supported by a judicial warrant. As a result, the report said, ICE closed its office on Rikers Island. New York received about $53 million  —   a tiny fraction of its budget  —   from the Justice Department in the most recent fiscal year, according to City Hall officials. Much of that funding goes to the police and corrections departments for the police crime lab ballistic helmets and vests for officers crime prevention programs drug and gang task forces and the like. Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement that the “latest threat” from the Trump administration “changes nothing” in New York. “Any attempt to cut N. Y. P. D. funding for the nation’s top terror target will be aggressively fought in court,” he said. While Mr. Sessions acknowledged on Monday that what he was discussing was essentially a continuation of the   policy, he suggested that it could be a first step to imposing more stringent requirements on federal money in the future. “We believe that grants in the future could be issued that have additional requirements, as every grant that’s being issued in America today usually has requirements that if you qualify for this grant, you have to meet certain requirements,” he said. “So we’ll be looking at that in the future, and we’ll continue to pursue it. ” Immigrant advocacy groups, civil rights organizations and Democrats sharply denounced Mr. Trump’s latest effort to highlight his tough stance. Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called the announcement an effort to “bully” immigrant families. “It’s simply outrageous that the Trump administration and their ICE agents are putting politics and scapegoating of immigrants ahead of public safety and the ability of local communities to decide how best to keep their communities safe,” said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice Education Fund. Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, called Mr. Trump’s approach “draconian. ” “Despite what Attorney General Sessions implied this afternoon, state and local governments and law enforcement have broad authority under the Constitution to not participate in federal immigration enforcement,” he said. The Trump administration has repeatedly signaled its intention to carry out an immigration crackdown. One of Mr. Trump’s first actions when he became president was signing an executive order that included an attempt to lay the groundwork for building a wall along the Mexican border and to encourage more agreements delegating to state and local law enforcement agencies the ability to enforce federal immigration laws.",0
44580,Steve Bannon Carries Battles to Another Influential Hub: The Vatican - The New York Times,"ROME  —   When Stephen K. Bannon was still heading Breitbart News, he went to the Vatican to cover the canonization of John Paul II and make some friends. High on his list of people to meet was an archconservative American cardinal, Raymond Burke, who had openly clashed with Pope Francis. In one of the cardinal’s antechambers, amid religious statues and   walls, Cardinal Burke and Mr. Bannon  —   who is now President Trump’s   eminence  —   bonded over their shared worldview. They saw Islam as threatening to overrun a prostrate West weakened by the erosion of traditional Christian values, and viewed themselves as unjustly ostracized by    political elites. “When you recognize someone who has sacrificed in order to remain true to his principles and who is fighting the same kind of battles in the cultural arena, in a different section of the battlefield, I’m not surprised there is a meeting of hearts,” said Benjamin Harnwell, a confidant of Cardinal Burke who arranged the 2014 meeting. While Mr. Trump, a   president who has boasted of groping women, may seem an unlikely ally of traditionalists in the Vatican, many of them regard his election and the ascendance of Mr. Bannon as potentially   breakthroughs. Just as Mr. Bannon has connected with   parties threatening to topple governments throughout Western Europe, he has also made common cause with elements in the Roman Catholic Church who oppose the direction Francis is taking them. Many share Mr. Bannon’s suspicion of Pope Francis as a dangerously misguided, and probably socialist, pontiff. Until now, Francis has marginalized or demoted the traditionalists, notably Cardinal Burke, carrying out an inclusive agenda on migration, climate change and poverty that has made the pope a figure of unmatched global popularity, especially among liberals. Yet in a newly turbulent world, Francis is suddenly a lonelier figure. Where once Francis had a powerful ally in the White House in Barack Obama, now there is Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon, this new president’s ideological guru. For many of the pope’s ideological opponents in and around the Vatican, who are fearful of a pontiff they consider outwardly avuncular but internally a ruthless wielder of absolute political power, this angry moment in history is an opportunity to derail what they see as a disastrous papal agenda. And in Mr. Trump, and more directly in Mr. Bannon, some   “Rad Trads”  —   or radical traditionalists  —   see an alternate leader who will stand up for traditional Christian values and against Muslim interlopers. “There are huge areas where we and the pope do overlap, and as a loyal Catholic, I don’t want to spend my life fighting against the pope on issues where I won’t change his mind,” Mr. Harnwell said over a lunch of cannelloni. “Far more valuable for me would be spend time working constructively with Steve Bannon. ” He made it clear he was speaking for himself, not for the Institute for Human Dignity, a conservative Catholic group that he founded, and insisted that he shared the pope’s goals of ensuring peace and ending poverty, just not his ideas on how to achieve it. Mr. Bannon publicly articulated his worldview in remarks a few months after his meeting with Cardinal Burke, at a Vatican conference organized by Mr. Harnwell’s institute. Speaking via video feed from Los Angeles, Mr. Bannon, a Catholic, held forth against rampant secularization, the existential threat of Islam, and a capitalism that had drifted from the moral foundations of Christianity. That talk has garnered much attention, and approval by conservatives, for its explicit expression of Mr. Bannon’s vision. Less widely known are his efforts to cultivate strategic alliances with those in Rome who share his interpretation of a   “church militant” theology. Mr. Bannon’s visage, speeches and endorsement of Mr. Harnwell as “the smartest guy in Rome” are featured heavily on the website of Mr. Harnwell’s foundation. Mr. Trump’s senior adviser has maintained email contact with Cardinal Burke, according to Mr. Harnwell, who dropped by the cardinal’s residence after lunch. And another person with knowledge of Mr. Bannon’s current outreach said the White House official is personally calling his contacts in Rome for thoughts on who should be the Trump administration’s ambassador to the Holy See. During Mr. Bannon’s April 2014 trip he courted Edward Pentin, a leading conservative Vatican reporter, as a potential correspondent in Rome for Breitbart, the website that is popular with the   a   movement that has attracted white supremacists. “He really seemed to get the battles the church needs to fight,” said Mr. Pentin, the author of “The Rigging of a Vatican Synod?” a book asserting that Pope Francis and his supporters railroaded opponents. Chief among those battles, Mr. Pentin said, was Mr. Bannon’s focus on countering a “cultural Marxism” that had seeped into the church. Since that visit and the meeting with Cardinal Burke  —   an experience that Daniel Fluette, the head of production for Breitbart, described as “incredibly powerful” for Mr. Bannon  —   Mr. Trump’s ideological strategist has maintained a focus on Rome. Mr. Bannon returned to direct the documentary “Torchbearer,” in which the “Duck Dynasty” star Phil Robertson contemplates the apocalyptic consequences of an eroding Christendom. Mr. Bannon also reunited with old friends, including Breitbart’s eventual Rome correspondent, Thomas Williams. A former priest, Mr. Williams said that he used to have arguments with Mr. Bannon about whether the pope subscribed to a   brand of liberation theology, with Mr. Bannon calling the pope a “ . ” Mr. Williams said he usually defended the pope, but that recent statements by Francis convinced him “Steve turned out to be right. That happens more often than not. ” Mr. Bannon’s private thoughts about the pope have at times surfaced in public. On May 23, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Williams spoke about Pope Francis on the radio program Breitbart News Daily. Discussing a Breitbart article about the new mayor of London titled “Pope Hails Election of Sadiq Khan, Celebrates Mass Muslim Migration Into Europe,” Mr. Bannon suggested that the pope “seems almost to be putting the responsibility on the working men and women of Italy and Europe et cetera, that they have to go out of their way to accommodate” migration. Was the pope a global elitist, Mr. Bannon asked, “two or three steps removed from this?” Many critics of Francis express similar views, but they are often scared to express it for fear of retribution from the pope, who, they say, has eyes and ears all over the Vatican. Instead, the pope’s critics anonymously papered Rome over the weekend with posters of a   Francis above complaints about his removing and ignoring clerics and cardinals. “Where’s your mercy?” it asked. Conservatives and traditionalists in the Vatican secretly pass around phony   of the Vatican’s official paper, L’Osservatore Romano, making fun of the pope. Or they spread a YouTube video critiquing the pope and his exhortation on love in the family, “Amoris Laetitia,” which many traditionalists consider Francis’ opening salvo against the doctrine of the church. Set to the music of “That’s Amore,” an aggrieved crooner sings, “When will we all be freed from this cruel tyranny, that’s Amoris” and “It’s the climate of fear engineered for four years, that’s Amoris. ” Cardinal Burke  —   who has said that the pope’s exhortation, which opened the door for divorced Catholics remarried outside the church to receive communion, might require “a formal act of correction”  —   has been unusually outspoken in his criticism of Francis. Cardinal Burke and Mr. Bannon declined to comment for this article. Just weeks ago, the pope stripped Cardinal Burke of his remaining institutional influence after a scandal exploded at the Knights of Malta, a nearly    chivalrous order where he had been exiled as a liaison to the Vatican. The pope had removed the order’s grand master after he showed disobedience to the pope. There was a sense in the order that the grand master followed the lead of Cardinal Burke because he projected authority, a power that stemmed in part from his support by the Trump administration, one influential knight said. Cardinal Burke has become a champion to conservatives in the United States. Under Mr. Bannon, Breitbart News urged its Rome correspondent to write sympathetically about him. And at a meeting before last month’s   March for Life rally in Washington, Cardinal Burke received the Law of Life Achievement, or Nail award, a framed replica of the nail used to hold the feet of Christ to the cross. According to   Westen, the editor of Life Site News, who announced the award, the prize is awarded to Christians “who have received a stab in the back. ” Despite Mr. Bannon’s inroads in Rome, Mr. Burke and other traditionalists are not ascendant in the Vatican. The Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit priest who edits the   journal La Civilta Cattolica and who is close to the pope, dismissed their criticism as the stuff of a noisy but small “echo chamber. ” He also played down the effect of Mr. Trump’s ascent on the standing of Francis’ opponents in the Vatican, saying it was only on a “level of image” and “propaganda. ” The pope will maintain his direction and not be distracted by fights against those trying to undercut him, Father Spadaro said. “He moves forward, and he moves ahead very fast. ” He added that Mr. Trump’s ban on immigrants from certain Muslim countries was “opposite” to the pontiff’s vision for how to foster unity and peace. The pope, Father Spadaro said, is doing everything he can to avoid the clash of civilizations that both fundamentalist Muslims and Christians want. Indeed, the pope does not seem to be slowing down. Days after the election of Mr. Trump, in St. Peter’s Basilica, the Vatican officially elevated new cardinals selected by Pope Francis who reflected the pope’s emphasis on an inclusive church  —   far from the worldview of Mr. Bannon and Mr. Burke. “It’s not that he is just bringing new people in that think maybe like him,” Cardinal Blase Cupich, the influential new cardinal of Chicago, said after the ceremony. “He is transforming the church in making us rethink how we have done things before. ” That transformation was evident later in the evening, when the old conservative guard came to pay their respects to the new cardinals. João Braz de Aviz, a powerful cardinal close to the pope, walked around in simple cleric clothes, the equivalent of civilian dress among all the flowing cassocks. Asked whether the ascent of Mr. Trump would embolden Mr. Bannon’s allies in the Vatican to intensify their opposition and force the pope to take a more orthodox line, he shrugged. “The doctrine is secure,” he said, adding that the mission of the church was more to safeguard the poor. It was also, he reminded his traditionalist colleagues, to serve St. Peter, whose authority is passed down through the popes. “And today, Francis is Peter. ”",0
70908, STUNNING New Report Shows HUGE Number Of Ineligible Electors – Could Put Trump Below 270,"A new report shows that we have at least 50 electors who were ineligible to cast their votes on Dec. 19. As a result, a nationwide, bipartisan legal team is preparing a 1,000+ briefing for members of Congress, who still have to certify the vote on Friday, Jan. 6. This number would bring Trump down from 306 to 256, making his election victory less-than Constitutionally legal.Republicans are absolute hypocrites   they only whine about election fraud when it looks like things aren t going their way. If things are going their way, then the votes are legit and any effort to prove otherwise is partisan bullshit. It s quite similar to how Trump said he d accept the results of the election prior to Nov. 8   if he was the one who won. Otherwise, look out, is what seemed to be his message.As part of their Electoral Vote Objection Packet, an advocacy group known as Americans Take Action tells Congress in no uncertain terms that at least 50 electoral votes were not  regularly given or not lawfully certified.  That number could actually be over 100. The group is non-partisan   they have Republicans as well as Democrats and Independents working on this.They also have 15 attorneys, legal assistants and law students who prepared the brief pro bono to deliver to Congress in a last-ditch effort to get them to object to certifying the Electoral College s votes. The illegitimate votes, according to the report, include two from Arkansas, one each from Louisiana, Michigan and Oklahoma, three from Texas, and seven from North Carolina.The report also includes electors who were ineligible because they already held public office, such as Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (who s suspect as it is given that she dropped a case against Trump after he donated several thousand dollars to her reelection campaign).Ryan Clayton, of Americans Take Action, an advocacy group that headed up the effort behind both the research and the briefing, said: Trump s ascension to the presidency is completely illegitimate. It s not just Russians hacking our democracy. It s not just voter suppression at unprecedented levels. It is also [that] there are Republicans illegally casting ballots in the Electoral College, and in a sufficient number that the results of the Electoral College proceedings are illegitimate as well.Republicans like to talk all the time about people voting illegally. We have a list of a bunch of Republicans that allegedly voted illegally in the Electoral College. Pam Bondi is the attorney general of the state of Florida and the Florida Constitution says that you cannot hold two offices. And she holds the office of Attorney General and she holds the office of federal elector in the Electoral College. That is a violation of the law. That is a violation of the Constitution. And the vote that she cast in this election is illegal. This is a last-ditch effort and we re sure everyone knows this. However, bringing this to the attention of Congress is the least anyone can do. We cannot have an illegitimate election, whether it s by hacking from a foreign power, illegitimate electoral votes, or both.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",1

62098,Comment on WATCH: Human Rights Activists Are Targeting The China Dog Meat Festival by information security architect,"WATCH: Human Rights Activists Are Targeting The China Dog Meat Festival By Travis Bille on April 24, 2016 Subscribe 
If you are easily sickened by dog cruelty, prepare yourself for this story. And if you have a dog or a cat that you love, I strongly encourage you to hold them and hug them right now as you read this. I assure you my three dogs are cuddled up with me as I write it. 
In Yulin, China, the government has gotten very good at looking the other way as the annual Yulin Festival brutally slaughters and consumes up to 10,000 dogs and 4,000 cats. Of course, the local government does not endorse the killing of dogs for meat. In fact, they’ve specifically said that they would ban the practice after the international outrage and online petitions sparked unwanted interest in the locals. 
But though it is no longer an officially-sanctioned festival, the yearly summer solstice celebration continues, the trading continues, the dog cruelty continues, and the outrage and protests grow larger every year. 
Those taking part in the festival insist that the animals come from mass breeding facilities, where they are specifically raised in humane conditions for this purpose. But a disturbing report from a Hong Kong-based group called Animals Asia says they found no evidence of any dog mass breeding facilities that could produce the animals at this level. 
The implication of this is what protesters have been saying for years: the dogs are either picked up as strays or, far too often, are family dogs stolen from their homes by city dog traders. Adam Parascandola of Humane Society International (HSI) confirms that many dogs rescued by protesters and brought to them are most definitely family pets: “We’ve seen all manner of dog breeds coming in to the rescue shelters, some of them obviously someone’s pet because they still have their collars on with their names.” 
Another excuse lobbed by festival-goers is that it’s no different than other people who eat beef, pork, chicken, turkey, etc. However, one of the most prominent grievances against the festival has little to do with consuming the animals and everything to do with how they are slaughtered. 
In the U.S., the farming industry has been under the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act since 1958. That specific act had little oversight from the start, until Temple Grandin came in and revolutionized the industry . While the process is still not perfect, and perhaps the process of humane death can never be perfect, it nonetheless requires regularly-audited measures to ensure the least amount of suffering possible. 
The Yulin Festival, however, has no such standards. Dog cruelty on display shows dogs and cats regularly shoved a dozen at a time into small cages where they await their fate. That fate is to be traded or sold, followed by a torturous death reported to include being beaten, skinned alive, electrocuted, boiled, burned, and finally eaten. 
Under the guise of tradition, dog traders justify it as no different than eating turkey at Christmas. However, the summer solstice “tradition” in Yulin only really goes back to the 1990s , and the actual festival wasn’t officially started by city dog meat traders until 2009 . Most of China no longer uses dogs for meat, and younger generations are now standing with protesters to end the practice and drop the “old ways.” 
As Yulin prepares for another year, the backlash prepares as well. There are many petitions on Change.org that have been going for years, some of which have millions of signatures, and many which are still active or new. Efforts are underway from WildlifePlanet.net to raise awareness, employing #Yulin2016 to bring together those opposed to the practices.
