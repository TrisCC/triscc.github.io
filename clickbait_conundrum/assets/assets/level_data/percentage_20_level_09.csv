498,OOPS! ABSOLUTELY NO ONE SHOWED UP For NYC Debut Of Beyonce’s Clothing Line…Is Her RADICAL Super Bowl Performance To Blame?,"I was in Nordstrom yesterday when our salesperson asked my teenage daughter and I if we had seen the new  Ivy Park  collection by Beyonce yet? My response to her was  no,  as I turned to my daughter and told her I wouldn t buy anything for her from that collection if it was the only thing Nordstrom sold. It wasn t that long ago I watched Beyonce dressed in her Black Panther inspired costume, performing a hateful, cop bashing song during Super Bowl 2016 (Watch HERE). I haven t forgotten and it s not likely I ll forget anytime soon.  People who love our country and are tired of seeing it being divided into categories of race and sexual orientation need to stand up to these race peddlers and hit them where it hurts in their bank accounts. Beyonce s radical, racist husband is making money hand over fist from people of all races, yet he s dumped over $1.5 million into groups and organizations specifically designed to divide our nation and instill hatred towards our law enforcement officers.  Cosmopolitan Since it was announced, people have been dying over the launch of Beyonc s highly anticipated womenswear athleisure line for Toyshop, Ivy Park. The collection, which hit stores today, is the type of collaboration that people wait hours in line for, trample each other for   you get the picture.My mouth dropped when I showed up for the launch of Ivy Park at Topshop s Soho location in New York. There was not a single person in line.No camping out overnight, no eager shoppers. It was so quiet I could hear the birds chirping. All I saw were people walking their dogs and grabbing their morning coffees. Where was the Beyhive? I couldn t have been the only one who cared. Because Beyonc .The doors were set to open at 10 a.m.Here was the scene an hour before the launch They were shocked by the low turnout too. I woke up and saw the hashtag and could see that London had crazy lines, so I felt like I had to rush to get down to the store,  said one shopper, Krystal.  Why are people not here? It s Beyonc . I don t understand. Her much hyped debut sportswear line launched at Topshop in London on Wednesday but Beyonce was no where to be seen.It is the pop star s first collection for Topshop so her no-show was a something of mystery considering the enormous hype surrounding the launch.Retail magnate Sir Philip Green, who owns Topshop among a number of other High St brands, said Beyonce was very involved in the collaboration. She saw every single piece on (and) was very involved in the development. My girls loved working with her and it really worked very well,  the clothing mogul told USA Today.Her no-show, however, speaks volumes. Via: Scout Breitbart News  Jay-Z s streaming music service Tidal will donate $1.5 million raised at a charity concert last year to Black Lives Matter and other social justice organizations.According to Mic, the money raised at last year s Tidal X charity concert   which featured performances from the streaming service s co-owners including Nicki Minaj, Jay-Z, and Beyonc    will go to to the New World Foundation, which funds a number of local and national social justice advocacy groups.Among the organizations that will receive donations are Hands Up United, the Opportunity Agenda, the Baltimore Justice Fund, New York s Million Hoodies and NY Justice League, and Illinois  Black Youth Project.Donations will also reportedly be given to Trayvon Martin Foundation, the Michael O.D.

65854,Moscow hopes Syrian opposition will attend Russia-backed congress: Ifax,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia hopes that all Syrian opposition groups will attend a Moscow-backed Syrian congress in southern Russia on Nov. 18 despite some objections, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said on Thursday, the Interfax news agency reported. The event, called the Syrian Congress on National Dialogue, was first mentioned by President Vladimir Putin last month who said he believed that militants in Syria would soon be defeated. It is due to be held in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.  But while Damascus has backed the Russian plan, some opposition groups have rejected the idea, calling it an attempt to rehabilitate President Bashar al-Assad s government. They have said they will stick to U.N.-brokered Geneva peace talks. Asked if Moscow still hoped to see opposition groups like the High Negotiations Committee, which has refused to come, attending, Interfax cited Bogdanov as saying:  We hope that everyone who believes that the fate of the country, its unity, its territorial integrity and its sovereignty are important will participate.

70306,WHY ARE VAN LOADS OF ILLEGALS Being Moved and Released Away From The Border?,"The insanity continues! The outrageous invasion on our southern border has been so out of control in the past seven years but it s gotten to crisis mode recently with a HUGE surge in illegals from all over the world. Yes, we ve become a GLOBAL MAGNET for anyone to cross our border. Soooo what s the reason for the illegals to be released? You ll never believe it! It s because the detention centers are FULL! No kidding! The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is quietly transporting illegal immigrants from the Mexican border to Phoenix and releasing them without proper processing or issuing court appearance documents, Border Patrol sources tell Judicial Watch.The government classifies them as Other Than Mexican (OTM) and this week around 35 were transferred 116 miles north from Tucson to a Phoenix bus station where they went their separate way. Judicial Watch was present when one of the white vans carrying a group of OTMs arrived at the Phoenix Greyhound station on Buckeye Road. The OTMs are from Honduras, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala and Border Patrol officials say this week s batch was in custody for a couple of days and ordered to call family members in the U.S. so they could purchase a bus ticket for their upcoming trip from Phoenix. Authorities didn t bother checking the identity of the U.S. relatives or if they re in the country legally, according to a Border Patrol official directly involved in the matter. American taxpayers pick up the fare for those who claim to have a  credible fear,  Border Patrol sources told JW. None of the OTMs were issued official court appearance documents, but were told to  promise  they d show up for a hearing when notified, said federal agents with firsthand knowledge of the operation.A security company contracted by the U.S. government is driving the OTMs from the Border Patrol s Tucson Sector where they were in custody to Phoenix, sources said. The firm is called G4S and claims to be the world s leading security solutions group with operations in more than 100 countries and 610,000 employees. G4S has more than 50,000 employees in the U.S. and its domestic headquarters is in Jupiter, Florida. Judicial Watch is filing a number of public records requests to get more information involving the arrangement between G4S and the government, specifically the transport of illegal immigrants from the Mexican border to other parts of the country. The photo accompanying this story shows the uniformed G4S guard that transported the OTMs this week from Tucson to Phoenix.Outraged Border Patrol agents and supervisors on the front lines say illegal immigrants are being released in droves because there s no room to keep them in detention.  They re telling us to put them on a bus and let them go,  said one law enforcement official in Arizona.  Just move those bodies across the country.  Officially, DHS denies this is occurring and in fact earlier this year U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske blasted Border Patrol union officials for denouncing this dangerous catch-and-release policy. Kerlikowske s scolding came in response to the congressional testimony of Bandon Judd, chief of the National Border Patrol Council, the labor union that represents line agents. Judd told lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee that illegal immigrants without serious criminal convictions can be released immediately and disappear into the shadows. Kerlikowske shot back, telling a separate congressional committee:  I would not stand by if the Border Patrol was   releasing people without going through all of the formalities. Yet, that s exactly what s occurring. This report, part of an ongoing Judicial Watch investigation into the security risks along the southern border, features only a snippet of a much broader crisis in which illegal aliens are being released and vanishing into unsuspecting American communities. The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest addressed this issue just a few weeks ago in a hearing called Declining Deportations and Increasing Criminal Alien Releases   The Lawless Immigration Policies of the Obama Administration. Judd, the Border Patrol Union chief, delivered alarming figures at the hearing. He estimated that about 80% of apprehended illegal immigrants are released into the United States.Read more: Judicial Watch",1
26960, WATCH: Donald Trump Receives Endorsement From Neo-Nazis in CRAZY New Video,"Donald Trump has attracted all sorts of fringe individuals and organizations as of late. He s attracted the most extreme elements of the Republican Party, and even the Ku Klux Klan is on board with his demonization of minorities and women. Now, Trump s extremist fan base has gone international with an endorsement from  Golden Dawn members, a far right neo-Nazi party in Greece which has a presence in the Greek parliament. In the new video, Trump is praised as a man who  doesn t fear to speak the truth. Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCwXFVhe6DE]Ilias Panagiotaros is a leading member of the party and he s on board with Trump s policies. Penagitaros has praised Hitler for having a  great personality.  Panagiotaros, along with Golden Dawn, has been linked to multiple offenses like murder, aggravated assault, trafficking, kidnapping, money laundering and extortion by the Greek government.Of particular excitement to Panagiotaros is when Trump infamously used a Mussolini quote to describe himself and then defended himself from the outrage, saying,  What difference does it make if it was Mussolini or somebody else,  Trump said.  It s a very good quote. As a result of the Greek economic collapse and the Syrian refugee crisis, Golden Dawn, which has an anti-capitalist platform and is anti-immigration, has gained more of a following. Thus, it should be of no surprise that Donald Trump has some racist fans in the international arena since his platform of denying Muslims entry into the US and building a wall to keep Mexicans out are comparable to that of this organization.The hope is that Donald Trump, along with the creepy Ted Cruz, who is likely even more racist than Trump with his personal brand of xenophobia, will never get to the presidency because if one of these men do, this country and its people are in deep trouble.

27770,CNN Predicts 2 Swing States Are Now Trending Toward Trump,"BREAKING: Trump Jumps in FL, Takes 4 Point Lead in OH 
Take for example Florida and Nevada, which had been consistently labeled “lean Democrat” by CNN but have now been shifted into the “battleground” category, according to The Hill . 
The shift was most likely due to a slew of new polls showing the race in Florida to be essentially tied, with some surveys placing Republican nominee Donald Trump up a couple of points while others still showed Clinton with a slight lead. 
The same holds true for Nevada . CNN also listed as “battleground” states places like Arizona, North Carolina, Ohio and Utah, even though Trump has shown a consistent lead in a few of those “toss-up” states. Advertisement - story continues below 
CNN still predicted a Clinton win, though her possible margin of victory had contracted significantly from previous estimates. 
CNN suspected that Clinton already has the 270 electoral college votes necessary to win via the states they have labeled “lean” or “solid Democrat.” 
Conversely, it projected that Trump only had about 179 electoral votes in hand from similarly labeled Republican states, leaving about 87 electoral votes up for grabs. 
Of course, as always, the situation remains much more fluid than the media would like to let on, and things can change quite rapidly, particularly considering that Clinton appears to be sliding in many states while Trump is steadily gaining ground across the country.

6930, Watch These Students SHUT DOWN Fox Host For Mocking ‘Rape Hysteria’ And ‘Repeated Consent’ (VIDEO),"It s no secret that conservatives believe with all of their hearts that serious, life-threatening issues that plague women every day of their lives aren t very important. So when Fox Business host John Stossel made a mockery of policies that have been put in place prevent rapes on college campuses over the weekend, he was shocked to find out that many people don t agree with his misogynistic jokes.The weekend segment was called  Campus Rape Hysteria,  and Stossel repeatedly argued throughout the program that there wasn t an epidemic and that any evidence related to sexual assault on campuses was debatable. Stossel also laughed at campus  initiatives that require men to have consent from a woman before and throughout a sexual experience. Stossel said: Colleges passed rules and some states passed laws that are supposed to protect women by defining the consent that s needed before a couple can have sex. California s law says  consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity. That means, I guess, a woman must repeatedly say,  Yes, please proceed.  I doubt many college students do that  but it is the law! To get his point across and show just  how crazy this could get, Stossel and his friends at Fox created a check-list-type form that mocked the consent process   except it wasn t received as well as he thought it would be.Fox News screenshotWhen Stossel showed his form to college students, most of them actually took the subject seriously   leaving the Fox host visibly disappointed that America s youth actually had morals and respect for women. He said: The kids must laugh at it. I can t believe anybody having sex gets repeated consent. Yet many students voiced the exact opposite. One male student said on the show, Something needs to be done. I m not sure this is the right way, but I think women need more protection.

24190, GOP Congressman Secretly Scrubbed This Embarrassing Info From His Wikipedia Page (IMAGE),"A Republican member of Congress was caught scrubbing his Wikipedia page of potentially embarrassing information, including his affiliation with a cult. Rep. David Jolly s (FL) congressional campaign was caught in the act. Jolly is running to replace Senator Marco Rubio after his failed presidential campaign.A spokesman for Rep. David Jolly (R-FL) told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday that the campaign removed certain information, including references to the Church of Scientology, that once appeared on Jolly s Wikipedia page.Spokeswoman Sarah Bascom confirmed to BuzzFeed that the campaign took off parts of the Wikipedia entry that told of Jolly s ties to Scientology. The campaign also removed references to Jolly s past career as a lobbyist and his past positions on gay marriage, according to the report.Jolly told a local newspaper the attempt to hide the information was a  careless staff mistake,  but the incident follows a pattern of politicians and their underlings attempting to remove information from the heavily trafficked encyclopedia site. Corporations have also previously been caught attempting to remove unflattering information or add PR fluff to the site as well.The information Jolly tried to remove has been restored, with a sentence noting:Jolly s relationship with the Church of Scientology, which is based inside his congressional district in Clearwater, Florida, has been reported on in the press, including Jolly s attendance at various fundraising events hosted by the organization.Via TheLipTV, here is the invitation for the Scientology fundraiser for Florida attorney general Pam Bondi involving David Jolly that his campaign tried to hide:David Jolly Scientology InvitationThe Daily Beast reported on Jolly s ties to Scientology in a story headlined  Scientology Could Get Its Own Senator.

61640,Rio ‘Has Never Felt So Safe.’ But What Happens After the Games? - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Portugal’s education minister was robbed at knife point. So was the chief of security for the opening ceremony as he left Olympic Stadium. A police officer was killed when his vehicle was sprayed with gunfire, and an Olympics bus carrying journalists was attacked by people throwing rocks. Even before the armed robbery this weekend of four American swimmers, including the gold medalist Ryan Lochte, a series of crimes had drawn attention to Brazil’s shortcomings in providing security for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. But for many in this   city, a bigger question remains: What will happen after the Games? To thwart crime around the Olympics, Brazil has mobilized a security juggernaut in Rio twice the size of the one used for the London Games in 2012. Mindful of Rio’s reputation for violent crime, the Brazilians have deployed 85, 000 security personnel. This show of force includes 23, 000 soldiers patrolling the city, some in military vehicles, along with helicopters and warships looming around the city’s most popular beaches. “The city has never felt so safe,” said Gilberto Dias, 50, a hot dog vendor who described how plainclothes officers had sprung to action one morning last week after two muggers accosted a tourist in the upscale Copacabana neighborhood. “They just materialized out of nowhere, which is something I’ve never seen before. ” But even before the Games began, Rio was facing a surge in lawlessness in recent months that had rattled residents and alarmed the authorities. With the economy in turmoil, assaults and robberies on the street jumped by 42 percent in May, with 10, 000 robberies that month. And after years of declining homicides, the number of murders increased by more than 7 percent during the first half of the year, with over 1, 500 people killed. As dread persists over street violence and gun battles rage in Rio’s favelas, some Brazilians worry about what will happen in the aftermath of the Games, when the soldiers are withdrawn and the city is left on its own to grapple with a financial crisis. “The assault on the American athlete is what happens to us in Rio every day,” said Marcello Brito, 51, an architect, referring to Mr. Lochte. Rio’s finances were so bad before the Games that it had declared a “state of calamity. ” Budgets had been gutted, with police officers and firefighters protesting delays in receiving pay by holding signs at the airport telling visitors, “Welcome to hell. ” The federal government responded with an $850 million bailout package to help the state of Rio de Janeiro stay afloat, pay salaries and keep essential services running during the Olympics. But the crisis in Rio’s finances, which are heavily dependent on global oil prices, remains, and the security lapses threaten to undermine ambitions for a resurgence in the city’s fortunes. The authorities invested billions of dollars in sports venues, transit systems and   pacification projects in poor urban areas, arguing that the Olympics would serve as a linchpin in overhauling the city. In the weeks before the Games, Mayor Eduardo Paes even contended that Rio would be “the safest city in the world. ” Many residents have welcomed the increased security. “It’s nice to see soldiers patrolling the streets, at least where I live,” said Cassius Almada, 39, a high school math teacher who lives in Copacabana. “It could be a lot worse. ” But those living beyond the necklace of upscale seafront neighborhoods say the increased security has had little effect in communities that have long been troubled by violence. Maria do Rosário Silva Santos, 54, who was visiting Rio from Brasília, the nation’s capital, said she had been stunned to see young men  —   not police officers  —   toting guns casually in Acari, a   neighborhood in north Rio, where she was staying during the Games. “It was shocking to see,” she said. “As far as I can tell, nothing has changed. ” Some security experts emphasized that considerable risks persisted around the city, especially in favelas, the poor areas that generally emerged as squatter settlements and that are still controlled by drug gangs. Because of Rio’s financial crisis, plans fell apart to establish a network of policing outposts in Maré, one large area of favelas. Julita Lemgruber, the director of the Center for Studies on Public Security and Citizenship at Candido Mendes University in Rio, said it was naïve to expect a drastic drop in crime during the Games. “The government thought a snap of their fingers would bring peace to a city that has lived through so much violence in the past few years,” she said. “It doesn’t do any good to have this show of thousands of extra police unless you tell every Olympic athlete to walk the street with a policeman by his side. ” The Olympics, she said, had actually increased bloodshed  —   but only in the vast favelas, where the police have been battling militias and drug gangs. In Complexo do Alemão, a large group of favelas, a   of gun battles since the start of the Olympics has left at least two residents dead and two police officials wounded. “Police forces are invading the favelas every day and killing people, which is outrageous,” Ms. Lemgruber said. “How can anyone hope to bring peace by spreading violence?” Heder Martins de Oliveira, the vice president of Brazil’s National Association of Police Officers, said that the killing of the officer in Rio last week pointed to the risks that security forces faced daily in the city. Referring to the wave of armed assaults during the Games, he said, “The situation would be even worse, an international disgrace, if dedicated police weren’t doing their job at this time. ” “Of course, there’s more attention to these episodes because they’re taking place when the world is looking at Rio,” Mr. Martins de Oliveira said. “But this is a dilemma that Rio faces on a daily basis. ” The police have also been involved in violent episodes blemishing the Olympics. Over the weekend, an   federal police official opened fire in the direction of a man he was brawling with at Rio Scenarium, a downtown nightclub. It was not clear whether anyone was seriously injured. Amid the surge in lawlessness, many residents have found a measure of solace on social media, where they commiserate about their experiences and document each episode of crime in hopes of spurring the authorities to action. Among dozens of Facebook groups focused on crime is “Where I was robbed,” a   map containing dots that form a road map of brutalization and despair. “Hello, hello, authorities!” one Facebook user, Eliane Cattapan, wrote recently. “With the arrival of all the tourists, I’m much more afraid of the rise in street crime than terrorism. ”",0

51377,Husband of Hoboken Crash Victim Struggles to Tell Their Child - The New York Times,"The man waited outside a day care center in Hoboken, N. J. He had a question for the owner: How was he going to tell his daughter that she would never see her mother again? His wife, Fabiola Bittar de Kroon, had been killed by falling debris after a commuter train barreled into Hoboken Terminal during the Thursday morning rush. She was the one fatality. Now, hours later, her husband, Adrianus de Kroon, was at Smart Start Academy, a day care center not far from the train station. He met with its owner, Karlos Magner, outside. “He said, ‘What should I tell her? How should I handle this? ’” Mr. Magner said. Mr. Magner had known children who had lost a parent to illness, he said, but never a death as sudden and violent as this. “I told him honestly: ‘I don’t know. There’s no book. Life, we’re not trained. We don’t know. So just stand strong,’” Mr. Magner recalled during an interview on Friday. Ms. de Kroon, 34, had dropped her daughter, Julia, at the center on Thursday morning about an hour before the crash. Her life ended just as she was paving a new beginning in the United States with her husband and her daughter, whom they had 20 months ago in her native Brazil. Mr. Magner said Ms. de Kroon left Julia at the center and picked her up every day, sending a flurry of kisses in her daughter’s way. “Her daughter is attached to her,” he said. The girl grew restless on Thursday as the hour that her mother normally arrived to get her came and went, Mr. Magner added. “She knew something was off,” Mr. Magner said. Ms. de Kroon moved to Hoboken in April. She had planned to look for a bigger place for her family on the day she died. “Maybe a house in Brooklyn,” she had told a close friend, Roberta Lima. Ms. de Kroon and Ms. Lima had communicated through cellphone messages over WhatsApp, a messaging app, on Tuesday, as they often did. Ms. Lima, 35, who lives in Rio de Janeiro, asked Ms. de Kroon when she would return to Brazil for a visit. Ms. de Kroon told her that she had planned a trip for December, in time to celebrate Julia’s second birthday. Ms. de Kroon was “a bit apprehensive to be living far from her family now that she had a child,” Ms. Lima said, but living away from family was nothing new to her. She and her husband, whom everyone knows as Daan, spent four years in Miami before moving to Brazil in 2011, where he led global business development for a Jamaican beer and a Brazilian cachaça brand owned by an international distributor, Diageo. Mr. de Kroon, who is Dutch, was working in the Brazilian city of São Paulo when he met his wife. Ms. de Kroon had grown up in Santos, on the Atlantic Coast, but moved to São Paulo for law school, Ms. Lima said. The couple moved to Miami in 2007, and they both studied business at Florida International University. “They were very focused on their careers and very much in love,” Ms. Lima said. Four years later they were back in Brazil. According to Ms. Lima, as the country’s economy sputtered, Mr. de Kroon moved to Asunción, Paraguay, to lead Diageo’s expansion there. Ms. de Kroon was pregnant at the time and decided to stay in São Paulo, close to her mother, Sueli Bittar. Mr. de Kroon would travel home on weekends, Ms. Lima said. Ms. de Kroon told her that moving to the United States would give the couple and their daughter a chance to spend more time together. In April, Ms. Lima helped organize a farewell gathering for the couple in Santos. They went out dancing, had some drinks, had fun, she said. “They were both very happy, full of plans, really excited about the move,” Ms. Lima said. Now, Mr. de Kroon will have to be “both mom and dad,” Mr. Magner said. The only advice he could think of offering the widowed father was not to broach what had happened with his daughter until he felt the timing was right. “Only the parent will know what is the right time and when to disclose it,” he said. “Children are like a sponge, they absorb so much, but they understand. ” Of Mr. de Kroon, Mr. Magner said, “He was strong, as strong as you can be in this situation. ” Ms. Lima and Ms. de Kroon were both 14 when they met, through a mutual friend. They last saw each other in Rio, at a birthday party for Ms. de Kroon’s twin nephews, shortly before she left for the United States. When a bomb exploded in Manhattan recently, Ms. Lima sent Ms. de Kroon a message to make sure she, her husband and their daughter were all right. “She told me, ‘Don’t worry, everything is fine,’” Ms. Lima recalled. “She said where they lived, on the other side of the river, was very safe. ”",0
56316,FOX HOST Calls Hillary ‘A Blight On Her Party’ After Her Response To #LasVegas Massacre [Video],"The first thing that comes to mind when you think of Hillary Clinton s response to the Las Vegas shooting is that she s gone on twitter and removed all doubt that she s clueless when it comes to guns and gun control. What s even more unbelievable is she wasted no time politicizing this horrific event while asking everyone else not to: We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again. She tweeted out several times just digging herself a deeper hole with her ignorance and lack of compassion for the victims: Her first tweet let us know she s clueless about the particular weapon used in this crime:The second tweet was another dig at the NRA and Clinton has the nerve to say we need to  put politics aside  when she isn t:Fox News host Christ Stirewalt said what everyone is thinking GO AWAY!:",1
62818, Hannity Gets His A** Handed To Him For Falsely Claiming Terence Crutcher Has Violent Criminal Past,"Fox News host Sean Hannity desperately tried to smear Terence Crutcher on Wednesday as a violent criminal who was wanted by police but was repeatedly shut down by a local Tulsa news anchor.Crutcher was shot and killed by white police police officer Betty Shelby even though he had his hands up and was surrounded by other police officers. The murder was caught on camera.Clearly, the unarmed Crutcher was not a threat to the safety of the officers, especially when you consider the fact that police officers have consistently taken in armed white suspects alive without ever firing a shot at them.But Sean Hannity repeatedly claimed during his radio show that Crutcher had a violent criminal record and had warrants out for his arrest. I understand that in this particular case Mr Crutcher has a long criminal history and appeared to be under the influence or so the police are charging,  Hannity said, which prompted Tulsa news anchor Russell Mills to smack Hannity down with facts. Well I ll tell you I looked up his history and I m not seeing a lot of criminal history,  Mills replied.  We have something called the OSCN   the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network. I was able to find a protective order from 12 years ago that was dismissed. I found a couple of financial things. There s no violent criminal history for Mr. Crutcher that I ve been able to uncover. But Hannity didn t want to hear the truth so he moved on to claiming that Crutcher had several warrants out for his arrest.Mills informed Hannity that there were no such warrants.Hannity responded that he read somewhere that there were warrants. I have not seen any reporting on any warrants for Mr. Crutcher and I certainly haven t uncovered any myself,  Mills said.  There has been some misinformation floated. A disappointed Hannity resorted to claiming that he has a  source  within the department and said that  it s a matter of time of when they re gonna release this information. Here s the audio via Media Matters:Once again, Sean Hannity tries to demonize another black victim of a police shooting in order to make people believe the shooting was totally justified. The bottom line, however, is that Crutcher had his hands up and was surrounded by officers. He wasn t a threat to them or anyone else but they executed him anyway. Officer Betty Shelby should be arrested and charged with murder. Period.Featured Image: Screenshot",1
51789,California Senate Race Is a Tale of Diversity and a Flailing G.O.P. - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   Kamala Harris made history when she became the first black woman to be elected attorney general in California. Now she is vying for the United States Senate, and she has managed to stay the   in the race ever since she announced last year, just days after Senator Barbara Boxer, a fellow Democrat, said she would leave the seat she won in 1992. With the help of allies, Ms. Harris nudged aside other prominent Democratic contenders, including Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles, and United States Representative Xavier Becerra. But as Tuesday’s open primary for the seat approaches, Ms. Harris’s chief rival is from her own party  —   Loretta Sanchez, a congresswoman from Southern California. And their competition says as much about California as it does about the candidates. In a state with one of the most diverse electorates in the nation, where Latinos are the largest ethnic group, a victory by either woman would be a milestone: Ms. Harris would be the first black woman in the United States Senate since Carol Moseley Braun, an Illinois Democrat who served from 1993 to 1999, and Ms. Sanchez would become the first Latina elected to the Senate. A recent Field poll shows the two leading a crowded ballot, including a pack of Republicans. The  open primary  —   approved by voters in 2010  —   will send the top two   regardless of party, to the November election. That contest will offer insight into just how diminished the Republican Party is in this state. Polling suggests that none of the many Republicans in the race can draw enough votes to even make the final ballot. In a recent interview, Ms. Sanchez said she knew she faced a formidable obstacle because many of the state’s leading Democrats would back Ms. Harris  —   who, like most statewide elected officials, comes from the Bay Area. “I knew that I would not have the establishment with me  —   they sent a message to all of us in Southern California,” Ms. Sanchez said. “But I’ve been told ‘no’ many times, and go on to make it work. ” Ms. Sanchez surprised many in the political world when she was elected to the House of Representatives 20 years ago, beating a Republican incumbent in Orange County, which for decades had been a Republican stronghold. Now, as then, Ms. Sanchez is counting on deep support from Latinos. Latino voter registration in California has nearly doubled this year, according to the secretary of state’s office, as voters also prepare to choose presidential nominees. Many believe those newly registered voters will turn out on Tuesday, driven in large part by   rhetoric from the Republicans’ presumptive nominee, Donald J. Trump. In a poll released in late May, Ms. Sanchez had the support of roughly 48 percent of Latinos, compared with 19 percent for Ms. Harris. “What’s the one thing that can motivate more Latino voters than ever before? Donald Trump,” said Dan Schnur, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. “The question will be how strong those loyalties are. ” Far from ceding any ethnic voting bloc, Ms. Harris has spent much of her energy courting Latinos. She secured endorsements from Hilda Solis, a Los Angeles County supervisor who was President Obama’s first labor secretary, and Dolores Huerta, a farmworkers advocate who appears in a   commercial for Ms. Harris. Speaking recently to a crowd of union officials in Commerce, a city east of Los Angeles, Ms. Harris emphasized her own family’s immigrant roots and her support for overhauling immigration law. “Latino voters are my voters,” she said. “They care about people’s commitment to their issues, and I’d match my record against anyone when it comes to looking at my longstanding commitment to all communities, including the Latino community. I reject the notion that this race is going to come down to ethnicity. It’s going to come down to what you’ve actually done and what you’ve demonstrated you can get done. ” For much of the race, Ms. Harris has largely ignored the rest of the field. She relies on the phrase “smart on crime” to convey her views on criminal justice and uses the label “fearless” in campaign advertisements. While her experience as the state’s top law enforcement official is her most important credential, she has never taken a position on a 2014   measure to release thousands of inmates and reduce sentences for nonviolent offenders. Ms. Sanchez, who is running her first statewide campaign, points to her work in Congress to portray herself as the candidate most prepared to deal with national security. She has promoted her support from colleagues in the House, campaigning with several of them in recent appearances. Representative Filemon Vela, Democrat of Texas, released a statement late last month calling the California Democratic Party’s support for Ms. Harris “insulting to Latinos all across this country. ” “Not one single Democratic Latina has ever been in the United States Senate,” Mr. Vela said in the statement, adding that the party’s position is ”a disrespectful example of wayward institutional leadership, which on the one hand ‘wants our vote’ but on the other hand wants to ‘spit us out.’ ” Though both women have aired commercials in the expensive media markets of the Bay Area and Los Angeles, Ms. Harris has raised more than three times as much money as Ms. Sanchez  —   $11 million compared with about $3. 5 million as of Friday, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the two televised debates, the three leading Republicans in the race focused much of their attacks on Ms. Harris. For them, the path to November relies on uniting Republican voters and a significant chunk of independents, who make up about a third of the state’s registered voters. “We have two people at the top of the national ticket who are really divisive,” said Duf Sundheim, a Republican candidate and a former chairman of the state party, who has not said whether he will back Mr. Trump in the fall. “I think it’s really important to have someone in the Senate who can really do things in the middle. ” Tom Del Beccaro, another Republican candidate and former chairman of the state party, has called for a flat federal income tax and said Congress should focus on setting stricter immigration laws. Just as often as he talks about his positions on issues, Mr. Del Beccaro discusses the mechanics of Tuesday’s primary ballot. With 34 names spread across two columns, he said, the ballot is too complicated, making it more likely that voters will not check boxes correctly. “The   primary drives down participation and creates a lot of guess work,” Mr. Del Beccaro said. Though he has raised hardly any money and has spent little time on the campaign trail, perhaps no other candidate has more directly pursued supporters of Mr. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders than Ron Unz, a software engineer and political writer who has endorsed both an increase in the federal minimum wage and more limits on legal immigration. Mr. Unz rose to prominence here more than a decade ago when he backed a ballot initiative opposing bilingual education. “The Republican Party in this state has almost been annihilated,” Mr. Unz said. “It’s going to be embarrassing for Republicans if they don’t even have a candidate in the fall, but this shows some enormous dissatisfaction with our respective parties that we will have to deal with in the future. ”",0
