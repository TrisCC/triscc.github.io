50481,Expecto Patronum! Patronus Test Keeps ‘Harry Potter’ Marketing Alive - The New York Times,"Here’s a question that separates a real “Harry Potter” fan from the rest of the muggles who think this is all just a bunch of wizarding gibberish: Is your Patronus a Siberian cat, a heron or a basset hound? The patronus charm, a cross between a spirit animal and a   charm, is one of the many bits of “Harry Potter” lore that fans continue to debate and celebrate nearly two decades after the first book was published. This has given J. K. Rowling, the boy wizard’s creator, plenty of time to turn her wizarding world into a finely tuned marketing machine. On Thursday, that machine delivered what it called the “only authentic Patronus experience,” allowing visitors to Ms. Rowling’s definitive fan site, Pottermore, to take a quiz and see what theirs would be. The test, produced with 3D animation and written by Ms. Rowling herself, quickly excited fans online, who used the social media incantation #ExpectoPatronum to share their results. Twitter erupted into a menagerie full of dolphins, polecats, aardvarks and Irish wolfhounds. Some very   fans played along. (There’s no way of knowing how many possible patronuses are out in the wizarding world. This writer’s patronus is a basset hound. The editor’s is a Siberian cat. Ms. Rowling’s is a heron.) Ms. Rowling and her employees at Pottermore hinted at this with some mysterious viral marketing. A day earlier, Potterheads were frantic over a mysterious tweet sent by Pottermore that showed a completely dark image, followed by images of a dark forest. But Potter obsessives are hard to fool: Most fans guessed what was happening right away.",0
35064,"In Stanford Rape Case, Brock Turner Blamed Drinking and Promiscuity - The New York Times","Brock Turner, the former Stanford University student convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a Dumpster on campus, described his actions as the product of a culture of drinking, peer pressure and “sexual promiscuity,” according to his courtroom statement. In a letter he submitted before being sentenced to six months in jail by Judge Aaron Persky of the Santa Clara County Superior Court, obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Turner said: “I am the sole proprietor of what happened on the night that changed these people’s lives forever. I would give anything to change what happened. ” The case has spurred a national uproar because of a sentence criticized as far too lenient and a statement by the defendant’s father complaining that his son’s life had been ruined for “20 minutes of action. ” The judge is also facing a recall effort and has received threats of violence to him and his family, an official said. The    victim read her own statement in court, recounting the horror of finding out details of her attack on the news (she had been intoxicated and could not remember the assault) and having to break the news to her family. Mr. Turner said the events of that night had left him “a changed person. ” In addition to his   jail sentence  —   far less than the   maximum  —   he will serve three years’ probation and must register as a sex offender. He also lost his swimming scholarship to Stanford. In his letter, he said the woman had consented to the sexual encounter, even as he admitted “imposing trauma and pain” on her. He repeatedly cited an environment of peer pressure, drinking and promiscuity, factors he said he would use his time on probation to advocate against. “I want to demolish the assumption that drinking and partying are what make up a college lifestyle,” he wrote. “I made a mistake, I drank too much, and my decisions hurt someone. ” The woman passionately denounced his interpretation  —   especially his emphasis on alcohol and promiscuity  —   in her statement “Alcohol is not an excuse,” she wrote. “Regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault,” she added. “We were both drunk the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately and run away. ” The victim’s statement went viral after it was published last week by BuzzFeed. It was read live on CNN by the anchor Ashleigh Banfield on Monday. On Wednesday afternoon, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said that his wife, Chirlane McCray, and other figures would read the statement from Gracie Mansion in a video posted to his Facebook page. .",0
61633,Queensland result leaves Australian PM closer to edge,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The loss of a state election in Queensland has stepped up pressure on Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who risks losing control of parliament at a by-election next month. Three Australian prime ministers have been ousted by their own parties since 2010, and a splintering of the conservative base in Queensland has raised questions over how long Turnbull s premiership can survive. Opinion polls already show his popularity at a record low.  Queensland s Liberal National Party (LNP), which replicates the federal coalition made up of Turnbull s Liberal Party and its partner the National Party, was hurt by voters, particularly in regional and rural areas, defecting to Pauline Hanson s right-wing, populist One Nation party. Vote counting is still underway, but the conservative divide has left the Labor Party on track to form the government in the coal-rich northeastern state. Smarting from this latest setback, Turnbull reminded voters on Monday that if they backed One Nation at the next federal election it could play into the hands of the center opposition.  Everyone is entitled to cast their vote as they see fit but the voting for One Nation in the Queensland election has only assisted the Labor Party,   Turnbull told reporters in the city of Wollongong, south of Sydney. The next federal election is due either in late 2018 or early 2019. But first up is the Bennelong by-election on Dec. 16. Should the Liberals lose the seat in Sydney s north, Turnbull would have to negotiate with independents and small parties to retain control of the House of Representatives, where the government is formed. It could heighten chances of deadlock between the two houses of parliament, which might force Turnbull to call an early election, just as he did last year. Regarded as a moderate, Turnbull has trouble holding on to voters leaking to the right following the resurgence of Hanson s  anti-immigration party, according to Queensland University of Technology political science expert Clive Bean.  In recent times Queensland has often been one of the states that has made the difference when it comes to whether the coalition wins government or not,  said Bean.  The seats that tend to bleed votes to One Nation do tend to be seats where the LNP is traditionally stronger.  Forecast to win just one seat in Queensland, One Nation polled almost 14 percent of the vote, spoiling the LNP s chances of taking the state off Labor. At the federal level, the ruling coalition s fragility has been exacerbated by rules forcing lawmakers holding dual nationality, which is prohibited, to recontest seats. Bennelong is one such seat, and should defeat there lead to the coalition losing control over the House of Representatives it would immediately undermine the prime minister s efforts to  stave off an inquiry into Australia s scandal-hit major banks. While Turnbull has distanced himself from the Queensland election result, maverick coalition member George Christensen tweeted an apology to voters who switched allegiance to One Nation, blaming the federal government for not standing up for conservative values.  A lot of that rests with the Turnbull govt, it s (sic) leadership & policy direction,  the tweet said. ",0
43258,Joe Biden: He's right not to run (Opinion),"It's hard not to like Joe Biden. I've seen him speak in person several times, and his love for people and politics is downright infectious. I'm sad he announced Wednesday he is not running for president, because he's fun and he would have lit up the campaign.

But I think he made the right decision.

The path to winning the Democratic nomination certainly wasn't clear, let alone easy, and it's better for Biden to end his career at the high point of the vice presidency rather than try for the presidency once again and fail. And while Biden seems genuinely to relish campaigning, campaigns are getting less and less fun by the day. The truth is that a Biden candidacy would have been enjoyable for voters (and the media). But it probably wouldn't have been very enjoyable for Biden.

More substantively, a Biden candidacy might simply have muddied the otherwise helpfully clear waters between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.

Take the first Democratic debate, where Clinton tried to argue that her plan for how to deal with the ills and excesses of Wall Street was ""more comprehensive"" and ""tougher"" than Sanders'. Sanders' response? ""Well, that's not true.""

On this issue, Sanders is right. He is a lifelong economic populist, to the point where he's not afraid to criticize the structural failings of capitalism and change the underlying rules of the game to make sure the economy helps poor people and working families. Clinton, on the other hand, has certainly embraced some of the rhetoric of populism in her latest campaign. But the extent to which it courses through her bones -- let alone her policies -- is questionable. In the middle of this debate would have been Biden. The vice president has more populist street cred from the get-go, especially rhetorically. I don't think I've ever heard Biden speak without mentioning his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. More importantly, despite a lofty career since then, he's always managed to maintain a straight shooter, ""Regular Joe"" style. But on policies, he's more closely aligned with Clinton than Sanders. Biden voted in favor of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act , which repealed part of the Glass-Steagall Act, opening the door to banks to engage in the wild risk-taking that crashed the economy. Biden sided with big banks in making it harder for Americans to reduce their amount of student debt. And Biden supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal (as Clinton did for a while before recently changing her view ). With a little more than a year until the presidential election, it's essential for Democratic voters -- and Americans in general -- to see a debate in the primaries in which conventional centrist economic policy is exposed and evaluated in light of a viable, populist alternative. Clinton and Sanders are having that very real and important debate. ""Regular Joe,"" who repeatedly promotes centrist policies that most help the country's elite, would have unhelpfully complicated things. ""I can die a happy man never having been president of the United States of America,"" Biden once told a reporter. ""But it doesn't mean I won't run."" Now, apparently he won't run. And while we should be grateful for his public service up until now, his decision is also a public service -- because the Democratic primary will run better without him.",0

28029,U.S. states mull contraception coverage as Obamacare repeal looms,"(Reuters) - Growing numbers of U.S. states are seeking to ensure that women have continued access to free birth control in case the insurance benefit is dropped as part of President-elect Donald Trump’s vow to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The 2010 law, popularly called Obamacare, requires most health insurance plans to provide coverage for birth control without a patient co-payment, which can be as much as $50 per month for birth control pills or $1,000 for long-acting contraceptives such as intrauterine devices. California, Maryland, Vermont and Illinois since 2014 have enacted statutes codifying the Affordable Care Act’s contraception mandate in state law and expanding on the federal law’s requirements. Democratic lawmakers in New York, Minnesota, Colorado and Massachusetts said they are pursuing similar measures this year, with Obamacare under mortal threat in Washington. New York’s Democratic attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, on Wednesday introduced such a measure in his state’s legislature that would expand on the Obamacare contraception mandate. “Women across New York are very concerned that Republican efforts to repeal the ACA will mean the loss of the contraception on which they rely,” Schneiderman said. “I won’t hesitate to act to protect New Yorkers’ rights - including the right to choose, and the right to birth control - no matter what a Trump administration does,” Schneiderman added, referring to abortion rights. Trump, who succeeds Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20, and his fellow Republicans in Congress have made dismantling Obamacare their “first order of business,” as Vice President-elect Mike Pence put it on Jan. 4. [nL1N1EU0RW] Republicans in Congress have not presented a detailed proposal for repealing and replacing the law but many Republicans and religious conservatives have opposed the Obamacare contraception mandate. [nL1N1EU0RW] Twenty-eight of the 50 states currently have laws requiring private insurers to provide coverage for birth control. But not all the laws affect all insurance plans, and only a few mandate cost-free birth control. OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES The Obamacare contraception mandate has applied since 2012 to most new insurance plans including employer-provided coverage. In 2013, for example, the mandate saved U.S. women more than $1.4 billion in out-of-pocket expenses for birth control pills, according to a report by University of Pennsylvania researchers. Almost 6.9 million privately insured U.S. women used the pill that year. The legislative move by some states, most of them Democratic governed, is designed to clear up uncertainty for some of the 55 million women who now have access to free contraceptives and related treatments under the Affordable Care Act. Conservatives also have chipped away at the Obamacare mandate in court. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that forcing family-owned businesses to pay for employee insurance coverage for birth control ran afoul of another federal law safeguarding religious freedom. The Supreme Court last May sent another legal challenge by nonprofit Christian employers back to lower courts to reconsider the matter after tossing out their rulings favoring the Obama administration. [nL2N18D0PL] “I think it is even more important now,” said Colorado state Representative Susan Lontine, who last year co-sponsored a contraception coverage bill in her state’s legislature that did not get passed but she expects to be resurrected in 2017. “We don’t know what will happen on the federal level.” California in 2014 became the first state to pass a contraception mandate that went further than the Obamacare language. Maryland, Vermont and Illinois last year passed laws that also eliminated co-pays for vasectomies and allowed women to fill a birth control prescription for at least six months rather than one to three.  The New York legislation would allow women to fill multiple months of a birth control prescription, prohibit private insurers from “medical management” reviews that could limit or delay contraception coverage, and provide coverage for vasectomies without a co-pay. Within a matter of months, the Trump administration even without congressional action could drop contraception from Obamacare’s list of preventive services that health insurance plans must cover without out-of-pocket costs, said Laurie Sobel, senior policy analyst at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. If repealed, some employers might choose to maintain the coverage without a co-pay because it is a relatively inexpensive benefit popular with employees. The proportion of privately insured women who paid nothing out of pocket for birth control pills increased from 15 percent in the fall of 2012 to 67 percent in the spring of 2014 during the time when the coverage went into wide effect, according to the Guttmacher Institute research organization. The no-cost contraceptives coverage also spurred women to switch to long-acting methods such as the IUD, which is offered in the United States by Bayer, Teva, Allergan and Medicines360, studies have found. More than 77 percent of women and 64 percent of men support the no-cost contraceptives coverage, according to a 2015 Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation survey. ",0
25737,Trump: No Salary for Me as President,"Report Copyright Violation Trump: No Salary for Me as President Billionaire U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Thursday he does not want the $400,000 annual salary that comes with the White House job and would turn it down if elected.Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination in the 2016 race despite having no political experience, was asked at a town hall-style meeting in Rochester, New Hampshire, if, as president, he would roll back generous pension and healthcare benefits given to members of Congress.

11206,The right turns on Paul Ryan: Yesterday’s conservative savior is today’s moderate wimp,"Rush Limbaugh: “I don’t remember a vice presidential pick that has so energized a campaign as this choice of Paul Ryan.”

Glenn Beck: “Mitt Romney has picked a solid, smart conservative for his vice-presidential running mate.”

Laura Ingraham: “More than anything today, we need a man with courage and clear-thinking. Ryan has both.”

Fast forward just three years and those same commentators are now raising doubts about Ryan, when not outright trashing him in public. Ryan’s sudden sin?  Not being sufficiently conservative; not passing the purity test.

Limbaugh: “This whole Ryan thing hasn’t made any sense to me from the first moment I heard about it.”

Beck: “The ‘fix’ the republic needs is Paul Ryan? The man who never met a bailout he didn’t like? A man who asked to be made king? 100% support and you can’t vote him out? Your solution is MORE POWER FOR THE SPEAKER?!?!?!?”

Ingraham: “From misrepresenting the outrageous Fast Track &TPP to amnesty & foreign workers, list of demands, Ryan’s possibly the worst Spkr choice.”

Ryan’s amazing free-fall from grace seems to be part of a larger race to the radical right, not only among powerful forces with the Republican Party, which now seem to be fundamentally opposed to governing and legislating, but also within key portions of the right-wing media. There seems to be a mini-stampede underway towards an extremist destination rarely seen in mainstream American politics. And for parts of the conservative media that means now demonizing former heroes like Paul Ryan.

“Conservative talk show hosts, including Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck, have already denounced him as a dangerous moderate,” according to Doyle McManus at the Los Angeles Times. “Tea party organizations are already raising money from supporters with appeals to stop any more Ryanesque budget deals.”

One of the many layers of irony here is that in 2012, the right-wing media defended Ryan from Democraticclaims that he was too far to the right and outside of the mainstream. Today, many conservative commentators are attacking Ryan for not being far enough to the right.

Yet “Ryan hasn’t undergone any sort of David Brockian-type worldview change that would warrant labeling him an apostate,” wrote conservative Matt Lewis at The Daily Beast. He added that while “Ryan’s voting record has its blemishes,” Ryan would “certainly be the most conservative Speaker of the House in modern history.” He still believes in privatizing social security and Medicare. He still believes that social programs are a “hammock.” He still believes that the Social Security survivor benefits that he and his family received throughout his adolescence cause dependency on other people and their families. A portion of the conservative press, of course, has never been in love with an establishment-type players like Jeb Bush, so his lack of support this year hasn’t been surprising. But Paul Ryan? He’s “the Republican party’s intellectual leader” as The Weekly Standard once touted. The conservative press could barely contain its universal glee when Ryan got the VP nod just three years ago. ‘He’s one of us,’ seemed to be the collective cheer. “Fox News, the most powerful right-wing media outlet in the country, has spent years praising Ryan as a ‘star,’ a ‘genius,’ and a man of ‘courage,'” Media Matters noted in 2012. -“He is the wrong man at the wrong time.”  [American Thinker] -“Paul Ryan represents one of the absolute worst outcomes for conservatives.” [Conservative Review] -“Despite his portrayal by the media as being conservative, most actual conservatives in the House know that Ryan isn’t a conservative.” [Breitbart] Breitbart, in particular, has become a clearinghouse of often-inaccurate analysis regarding Ryan, such as claiming the Republican’s bid for the speakership had recently collapsed. Breitbart even warned readers that Media Matters “has Paul Ryan’s back,” as proof the Republican cannot be trusted. In a sign of how fractured and radical the conservative movement has become, it appears fewer and fewer media players have Ryan’s back. Even though they cheered him as a savior in 2012.",0
39865,NBC Reviving ’Must-See TV’ Thursdays with ’Will &amp Grace’ - Breitbart,"NEW YORK (AP)  —   NBC is bringing back its “  TV” Thursday franchise this fall with the revival of “Will  Grace,” and by moving its heartwarming hit “This is Us” to the same night. [The network announced its schedule Sunday, kicking off the annual week where broadcasters outline next season’s plans to advertisers. NBC is the second most popular network behind CBS, first among the younger viewers it covets, and is bullish on next year since it will show the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl.  The comedy “Will  Grace,” which originally aired from 1998 to 2006, unites its original ensemble of Debra Messing, Eric McCormack, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally with the original creative team. If the resumption goes well, NBC hopes there will be more than the 12 episodes now on order, said Robert Greenblatt, NBC entertainment chairman. “Will  Grace” will kick off Thursday’s lineup, followed by “Great News,” a sophomore comedy produced by Tina Fey. Greenblatt said Fey will appear periodically on air next season, too. The key to reestablishing Thursday nights, which NBC dominated during the 1980s and 1990s, is bringing the fans who made “This is Us” the year’s biggest new hit, to that night at 9 p. m. The show also gets the   slot after next winter’s Super Bowl. Greenblatt sounded conflicted about how much NBC will push the “  TV” concept promotionally. “I’m not saying it’s going to be emblazoned with   letters atop the Empire State Building, but we’re going to use it,” he said. NBC will introduce eight new series next season but sprinkle them throughout the year. Only the “Will  Grace” reboot, a Dick   limited series on the Menendez murders and “The Brave,” an action series starring Anne Heche as an undercover military hero, will begin in the fall. Doing it that way illustrates the elastic nature of broadcast television, when shows drop on and off the schedule throughout the year, and the goal is to reduce repeats. As a result, Greenblatt wouldn’t say when the other five new series will appear. Some established shows, like “Chicago Med” and “Little Big Shots” were renewed but don’t have announced spots on the schedule yet. The     nature of TV will be a barrier for NBC: the Thursday schedule it hopes becomes dominant will be   for pro football in the fall and the Winter Olympics. NBC said it was offered “American Idol,” which rival ABC announced it was bringing back next season. NBC said the strength of “The Voice,” which will add former “Idol” stars Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson as coaches next year, and its other development led it to say no, thanks. “The audience didn’t tell us there was a compelling reason to bring it back, either,” said Paul Telegdy, president of NBC’s alternative and reality series. NEW SERIES, Other new series ordered by NBC:  —  “Good Girls,” a drama about three suburban moms who rob the local supermarket. It’s described as a mix between “Thelma  Louise” and “Breaking Bad”  —  “Reverie,” a thriller about a former hostage negotiator brought on to save people lost in a virtual reality program,  —  “Rise,” a drama starring Josh Radnor as a teacher who revives a lackluster high school theater department,  —  “A. P. Bio,” a comedy produced by Lorne Michaels and Seth Meyers about a philosophy scholar who goes to work teaching biology in high school,  —  “Champions,” a Mindy   series about a gym owner and his brother who must cope with a new   in the household. ___, NEVER CAN SAY GOODBYE, After first announcing the cancellation of the time travel series “Timeless,” NBC bowed to fan complaints and said it would bring the freshman series back. NBC also didn’t include some other series in its order for next season  —   “Chicago Justice,” ″Trial  Error” and “The Carmichael Show”  —   but Greenblatt said that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re dead. ___, “NEW GIRL” There’s good news and bad news for fans of the Zooey Deschanel’s Fox series “New Girl. ” Fox, which will present its schedule Monday, announced a day in advance that the series will be back for a seventh season  —   but that will be its last.",0
38212,The Trump presidency on Feb. 13 at 8:05 P.M. EST,"(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Monday: Trump says the United States will be “tweaking” its trade relationship with Canada, stopping short of calling for a major realignment in a development likely to please visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump is evaluating the situation surrounding U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn over his Russian contacts, Trump’s spokesman says, pointedly declining to make a public show of support for the aide. The U.S. Senate votes to confirm former banker and Hollywood financier Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, installing the Trump administration’s point-man on tax reform, financial deregulation and economic diplomacy efforts. A U.S. federal judge rejects a Justice Department request to suspend Seattle courtroom proceedings over Trump’s temporary travel ban from seven Muslim-majority countries until an appeals court has fully reviewed it. Benjamin Netanyahu opposes a Palestinian state, a senior Israeli Cabinet member says, but leaves it unclear whether the prime minister would say that publicly in talks with Trump in Washington this week. Trump says North Korea is a “big, big problem” and that he will deal with it “very strongly” after that country said it successfully test-fired a new type of ballistic missile. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, fresh from a visit with Trump, says the U.S. stance toward North Korea is likely to become tougher. China’s Foreign Ministry is concerned that Japan has received continued U.S. backing for its dispute with Beijing over islands in the East China Sea during a meeting between Trump and Abe. A congressional tax oversight committee will not seek Trump’s tax returns, despite calls from Democrats for a review to determine possible business ties to foreign countries including Russia, the panel’s Republican chairman says. U.S. equity indexes hit record highs, with the benchmark S&P 500’s market value topping $20 trillion as investors bet tax cuts promised by Trump will boost the economy.   The Kremlin says there is talk of a possible meeting between Trump and President Vladimir Putin before a G20 summit in July, but there is nothing specific on this so far. ",0
18810,4 Trailers That Have Us Excited for 2017 - The New York Times,"A new year brings new movies, of course, but their promotion has already begun. With a full slate of films headed to the big screen in the next few months, here’s a look at notable trailers. Feb. 10 THE MOVIE In the sequel to the   smash “Fifty Shades of Grey,” Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) try to reconnect after she left him when his    tastes proved too extreme for her. WHY THE TRAILER IS INTRIGUING Well, it’s at least one shade darker. Ana seems to have a stalker. Or maybe she’s a hallucination? This woman appears a few times, creepily hovering like the girl from “The Ring,” but that’s all we get. Her presence is never explained, even though it’s one of the few things that suggest this film is different from the last one. Otherwise, “Fifty Shades Darker” seems to take everything people liked and loathed about “Fifty Shades of Grey” and double it. Meaningful glances are everywhere. Some scenes in the trailer are a little more suggestive, though there might be a public indecency law broken in one of them. Even the wooden dialogue is back. (Although perhaps more   the first line of the trailer, “I want you back,” feels like a plea from the producers.) Even the music is the same. The trailer for “Fifty Shades of Grey” was set to a slower, spookier remix of Beyoncé’s “Crazy in Love. ” Not to be outdone, this trailer brings in the RB star Miguel for a breathy, hauntingly sexy cover that’s just distinct enough to merit notice. And hey, why not? The music worked last time.  March 3 THE MOVIE After playing Wolverine for close to two decades, Hugh Jackman is set to hang up his adamantium claws in the latest chapter of the   saga, which takes its name from the character’s civilian identity. WHY THE TRAILER IS INTRIGUING The previews for   movies tend to draw on the familiar: iconic costumes and spectacular C. G. I. set pieces while   superheroes. Innocent bystanders are in peril. Something explodes. Not the trailer for “Logan,” released in October, which sweeps all mentions of   or Wolverine under the rug. Instead, it suggests a   western. Johnny Cash’s cover of “Hurt,” a song about pain, provides the through line, connecting all the shots of a weary, older Mr. Jackman. The   Logan is shown alone, backed by dusty deserts and rusting equipment. He’s battered, bloodied and wizened. It’s Wolverine, by way of Clint Eastwood. The trailer positions Logan as a Wild West outlaw, making a break from the superhero genre. When antagonists appear, they arrive in a caravan of police cars. One character even wears a cowboy hat and poncho. So by the time Logan finally unsheathes his claws, toward the trailer’s end, it’s a jarring tonal break from what seems like a quieter, smaller film. April 28 THE MOVIE Based on Dave Eggers’s novel, “The Circle” follows Mae (Emma Watson) an eager   with a job at the Circle, a Silicon Valley tech behemoth that Mr. Eggers has said is definitely not Google, Apple or Facebook. WHY THE TRAILER IS INTRIGUING It totally makes the movie seem like it’s about Google, Apple or Facebook, at a moment when that couldn’t be more relevant. The film’s first trailer, released in early December, opens with Mae describing the Circle as “the chaos of the web made elegant. ” In the midst of the postelection   over social media and fake news, that characterization certainly stands out. After that, Mae attends a keynote address delivered by a Circle leader, played by Tom Hanks, who stands in front of the company logo and wears a dark sweater that looks like the love child of Mark Zuckerberg’s hoodies and Steve Jobs’s classic turtlenecks. He speaks about the power of technology, luring us in with his “America’s Dad” voice, while Mae and her colleagues attend meetings and take selfies. “Sharing is caring,” they chant emphatically. It’s a sharp contrast from a   discussion about whether that’s actually true. (Oh, hey, don’t forget to share this column on Facebook!) The dark turn is inevitable, even without our current conversation about technology in 2016. So the trailer adds to the drama with a   and   cover of the Hall  Oates song “Private Eyes. ” A voice chants over piano, “They’re watching you,” drawing audiences further in with a foreboding warning about both the story onscreen and what might be happening off. May 12 THE MOVIE Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn are a   pair who go on vacation in South America and get, uh, snatched. It’s Ms. Schumer’s   to her successful 2015   “Trainwreck,” and Ms. Hawn’s first film appearance in 15 years. WHY THE TRAILER IS INTRIGUING Comedy trailers can be a tough sell. They have to keep us laughing for two minutes while promising there’s enough to keep us laughing for two hours. That requires shoehorning exposition and plot into a tight comedic structure without shortchanging the humor. The “Snatched” trailer, released in December, finds the right balance. It’s certainly  . From the start, it establishes Ms. Schumer’s character in an embarrassing breakup scene that brings her comedy chops to the forefront. Then it zips along to her mother’s home, where Ms. Hawn awkwardly comforts Ms. Schumer with a hug that immediately establishes the uneasiness in their relationship. The trailer ushers them to South America with a quick conversation that further explains who they are: a young woman trying to find herself and a mother mired in routine. As the trailer introduces more plot elements  —   a man, the titular snatching, the escape  —   it keeps the jokes coming with a remarkable narrative economy. Plus, it gives equal time to Ms. Schumer and Ms. Hawn, suggesting both women will be making memorable returns to the big screen.",0
63467,New Zealand's kingmaker party sets Thursday to unveil result of talks to form government,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand s small nationalist party, which holds the balance of power after last month s inconclusive elections, will make an announcement on Thursday on the result of talks with the two major parties to form the next government. The move should put an end to weeks of political uncertainty in the small Pacific island nation, after neither major party won enough seats on Sept. 23 to form a government, leaving both courting the leader of New Zealand First, Winston Peters.  New Zealand First will be in a position tomorrow afternoon to make an announcement on the result of negotiations following the 2017 general election,  the party said in a statement. Thursday s event could also shed light on the economic direction for New Zealand, since both the National Party and the Labour Party differ on immigration and trade, key sources of the country s robust growth in recent years. Peters has held lengthy talks with both National, which has been in power for nearly a decade, and opposition Labour, but has kept his cards close to his chest regarding coalition prospects. Peters has notified the leaders of both parties about Thursday s announcement, the statement added. The New Zealand dollar, already under pressure earlier on Wednesday, briefly fell to the day s low of $0.7153 after the statement.  If it goes down the path of a Labour-Green coalition, we can expect the kiwi will probably come under far greater pressure, purely on the basis that that is a complete unknown,  said Stuart Ive, a dealer at OM Financial.  If it s announced that a National coalition is being formed, we can probably see the kiwi pick back up again,  in a short relief rally before markets return to focusing on economic fundamentals, he added, using the currency s nickname. NZ First has more in common with Labour on the policy front, as both want to rein in immigrants and foreign ownership, change certain trade deals and adjust the central bank s mandate. But some analysts say a two-way coalition with National would be more straightforward than a three-way coalition with Labour and the Greens. Labour needs the seats of both the Greens and New Zealand First to reach a majority in parliament.  ",0
63037,Trump administration imposing new email security protocols for agencies,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Monday will order federal agencies to adopt common email security standards in an effort to better protect against hackers, a senior Department of Homeland Security official said. DHS Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity Jeanette Manfra, speaking at an event in New York, said the agency would issue a binding directive to require implementation of two cyber security measures, known as DMARC and STARTTLS, intended to guard against email spoofing and phishing attacks. The new requirements are “discrete steps that have scalable, broad impact” that will improve federal government cyber security, Manfra said. DMARC, or domain-based message authentication, reporting and conformance, is a decade-old popular technical standard that helps detect and block email impersonation, such as when a hacker might try to pose as a government official or agency. STARTTLS is a form of encryption technology that protects email traveling between servers, making it more difficult for a third-party to intercept. Civilian agencies will have 90 days to implement the new security measures, Manfra said. Many agencies already use DMARC and STARTTLS but recent reviews have found the protocols are not used universally across government. Foreign governments and other hackers have pilfered millions of personal records and other sensitive data from the U.S. government in recent years. The Trump administration has made upgrading government agencies’ much-maligned network security a top cyber priority. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who earlier this year pushed federal agencies to adopt the security standards more widely, said in a statement the moves were “two cheap, effective ways to secure email from being intercepted or impersonated by bad guys.” He said he hoped the decision would compel private sector companies to upgrade their own email security quickly. An August report from the Global Cyber Alliance, an international non-profit, found that federal government adoption of DMARC had been rising in recent months but that less than 10 percent of domains had the protocol fully implemented. Usage of DMARC is much higher on the consumer level with 85 percent of inboxes, including those hosted by Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O) or Microsoft (MSFT.O), supporting the standard, according to the Global Cyber Alliance.

64987,"Cleveland Indians, With a Surprise Starter, Silence the Toronto Blue Jays Again - The New York Times","CLEVELAND  —   For the first two games in the American League Championship Series, a clear pattern has been established: The Cleveland Indians pitch well, take a slim lead and then hand the ball to their impenetrable bullpen to secure the win. That formula has proved extremely potent, and it has the Indians closing in on their first A. L. pennant in 19 years. For the slumping Toronto Blue Jays, perhaps their only route to victory would be to somehow seize the lead before the Cleveland relief corps of Bryan Shaw, Andrew Miller and Cody Allen could be unleashed upon them. “I’ll be able to let you know if we get into that situation,” Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin said with a   smile. “Hopefully, we do. Hopefully, we can talk about that. ” Thus far, the Blue Jays have been left largely speechless and nearly scoreless. They were shut out in Game 1 on Friday and held to just three hits in Game 2 on Saturday, losing,  . Toronto’s anemic offensive output was a result of another terrific performance by the Indians’ pitchers, beginning with the starter, Josh Tomlin, who outdueled the   winner J. A. Happ. The Indians scored 777 runs in the regular season, and the Blue Jays scored 759. But this is October baseball, when hurlers dictate to hitters. “The pitching has been great on both sides,” Toronto Manager John Gibbons said. “That’s all there is to it. ” This is the first time in five trips to the A. L. C. S. that the Indians have won the first two games, and that bodes well for their future: Only three of the last 27 teams that went ahead by   in a league championship series failed to advance to the World Series. The Indians were not highly regarded after spring training, and they have not won a World Series in 68 years. But they are only two wins away from reaching the Series again, and their success has drawn the attention of the city’s other sporting success story, the Cavaliers. LeBron James, Kevin Love and some of their teammates attended the game on Saturday. “When they show the Cavaliers on TV because there are two strikes on the batter or there are two men on base and they get loud, it’s a blast to be a part of,” Miller said. But Game 3 will be Monday in Toronto, where the Jays hope that the   support in Rogers Centre will enliven their suddenly moribund bats. “We play good at home,” Gibbons said. “Get in front of our crowd  —   maybe that will energize us and maybe get some things going. But our back is against the wall. That’s pretty obvious. ” Everything the Indians could have asked for was at their disposal Saturday, except their intended starting pitcher, Trevor Bauer. Progressive Field was sold out on a warm, sunny autumn afternoon. The 37, 870 announced fans included James, Love and the Cavs as well as the former Indian Kenny Lofton. Cleveland’s elite bullpen was ready to pitch, and Francisco Lindor, the Indians’      shortstop, was batting third. Lindor’s   homer in Game 1 provided all the scoring in that game, and his   single in the third on Saturday  —   after Carlos Santana’s   home run  —   gave the Indians the winning run in Game 2. Lindor now has three straight   postseason games, along with two home runs and four runs batted in. He also made a terrific jump throw from the hole at shortstop, reminiscent of the plays that Derek Jeter made so often for the Yankees. But it has been Cleveland’s pitching that has made even the slimmest of margins hold up. Tomlin, the Indians’ third starter, was asked to pitch Game 2 because Bauer injured his right pinkie while working on a drone. Tomlin allowed one run and three hits in five and   innings, and Shaw finished the sixth. Then the drama rose. Miller arrived in the seventh inning and, with his dominating combination of fastball and slider, struck out the side Martin, Melvin Upton Jr. and Kevin Pillar all went down swinging. Miller returned in the eighth and struck out Darwin Barney. Ezequiel Carrera finally put a ball in play, but grounded out. Miller then struck out Josh Donaldson to finish with two perfect innings and five strikeouts. Then it was Allen’s turn, and he would have to face the meat of the Toronto order: Edwin Encarnacion, Jose Bautista and Troy Tulowitzki. He struck out Encarnacion, then faced Bautista, a man famed for hitting thrilling postseason home runs. When Bautista went down swinging, the crowd roared as loudly as some had heard it at the stadium all year. Allen certainly felt it. “You try not to get caught up in it, because it was only the second out,” he said. “I didn’t want to lose my focus, but you could feel the energy in the stadium. You definitely could. ” Finally, just 2 hours and 44 minutes after the first pitch, Tulowitzki flied out to center for the final out. Donaldson, with a   double in the third inning, had the only hit among the top five batters in the Toronto lineup. Barney, the No. 9 batter, had a single, and so did Martin. Perhaps it will go better in Canada, where the Blue Jays love to hit. “History,” Martin said, “shows that we can hit the baseball. ” But history also shows how hard it is overcome the deficit Toronto faces.",0
7559,Billionaire Branson targeted in $5 million scam 'straight out of le Carre',"LONDON (Reuters) - Richard Branson, billionaire founder of the Virgin group, has revealed he was targeted by a fraudster posing as Britain s defense minister who tried to get him to contribute $5 million to a supposed secret ransom payment. Appealing for information to help identify the conman, Branson said he suspected the same person had later impersonated him to steal $2 million from a friend of his by pretending to raise funds for people affected by Hurricane Irma.  This story sounds like it has come straight out of a John le Carre book or a James Bond film, but it is sadly all true,  Branson wrote in a blog. Instantly recognizable with his wavy blond hair and beard, Branson is one of Britain s best-known businessmen. The Virgin brand is licensed for use by a range of businesses from airlines to train companies to telecoms and gyms. Branson wrote that six months ago, after an elaborate set-up involving a note on fake government notepaper, he spoke on the phone to someone purporting to be Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. The man told Branson that a British diplomat had been kidnapped and was being held for ransom by terrorists. He said that while the government did not pay ransoms, there was a particularly sensitive reason why the diplomat had to be saved, and the government was confidentially asking a syndicate of British business people to step in.  I was asked to contribute $5 million of the ransom money, which he assured me the British government would find a way of paying back,  Branson wrote. Feeling suspicious, Branson checked with the government and was told that Fallon had not spoken to him. The matter was reported to the police. Six months on, Branson learnt that a friend, whom he described as a very successful businessman in the United States, had been called by a conman posing as him.  When the call happened, the conman did an extremely accurate impression of me and spun a big lie about urgently needing a loan while I was trying to mobilize aid in the BVI (British Virgin Islands),  he wrote. Branson owns a small island in the BVI archipelago which, as was well publicized, was devastated by Hurricane Irma. The caller took advantage of that context.  They claimed I couldn t get hold of my bank in the UK because I didn t have any communications going to Europe and I d only just managed to make a satellite call to the businessman in America,  Branson wrote.  The business person, incredibly graciously, gave $2 million, which promptly disappeared.  A spokesman for Fallon said he was aware of two attempts, one not involving Branson, to impersonate the minister for illicit gain, and Fallon s office were assisting the police in their efforts to try to catch those responsible.

That s the problem with our country, we don t have fighters in our country. And his critics are just gonna have to  deal with it. Donald Trump is on the cover of Time magazine, and the headline reads:  Deal with it. The meme-worthy photo shoot features the Republican presidential hopeful posing with a 27-year-old American bald eagle   the emblem of the United States. Every frame was the same,  Schoeller told TIME.  Mr. Trump knows exactly how he looks, and he strikes one pose and doesn t move. The same could not be said for 27-year-old Uncle Sam, who was hit by a car in the 1990s and has since segued into a life on the educational and entertainment circuits. He s very difficult to photograph,  said Schoeller.  If you ask him to look up a little bit, he says no or he just doesn t do it. He literally has one angle. If I ask him to smile, he puts on a big grin and then he goes back to his Zoolander  blue steel  look. The  blue steel  look appears, sans eagle, on the cover of this week s TIME.It s a look America has grown very accustomed to since Trump became a household name in the 1980s and one they ve been showing their love for more than ever in recent months.The Republican front-runner said it all on Wednesday that when it comes to the polls in the crowded 2016 presidential race,  the only thing constant is Trump. Asked at a news conference ahead of a town-hall forum in New Hampshire who he saw as his strongest rival in the crowded Republican field, Trump said:  You know it changes.

I m doing this to make America great again. Here is a great interview by Entertainment Tonight:Trump told TIME magazine,  I don t have a racist bone in my body. The fact that I want a strong border and the fact that I don t want illegal immigrants pouring into this country, that doesn t make me a racist, it means I love this country and I want to save this country.

After all, this is the man who famously claimed he could  stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn t lose voters.  His voters have never proved him wrong on that. He has consistently been just one of the worst humans ever to walk the planet in every way, and his base is still as fervent as the day they vaulted their racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic asshole into power.This video is not for them, though.

39625,"What is an ""income"" tax and where did it come from? NOT the 16th Amendment!","License DMCA The financial system in America is a scam of world proportion. All of our lives, we've been taught, and often reminded, that the so-called ""income"" tax originated with the 16th Amendment in 1913, and authorized a tax on our earnings. The IRS repeatedly claims this as their authority to tax American's wages, but is this true? Have YOU ever looked into the evidence and history of this tax to see if you actually owe such a tax, or actually even receive ""income""? Most Americans will have to say, no they haven't. So, we simply plod on taking what we've been told as true and factual, and comply by voluntarily assessing ourselves every year without another thought... except that we hate having to do it unless it is to get back some or all of what should never have been taken in the first place. With the advent of the personal computer and the internet, things have changed. What once took many months or even years of research in law libraries and other sources of actual documents now takes days or weeks... perhaps months, and what is being discovered is not only revealing, it is shocking. Is it possible that we have been deceived for over 100 years on the topic of our financial system and ""income"" taxes? Let's start with in ""income"" tax. What does the 16th Amendment actually tell us? ""The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration."" The key words in this amendment are ""incomes"" and ""whatever source derived"". ""Income"" is the one which is grossly misunderstood. We will come back to what this amendment is actually speaking to further down in this article. First, we must realize how millions of people can be deceived... ""When a well-packaged web of lies has been sold gradually to the masses over generations, the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic."" Dresden James. It's time we look carefully at the evidence of historical records and decide if this is the ravings of a lunatic, or simply a message based on actual evidence that has, at best, been misunderstood, or at worst, purposefully suppressed and manipulated for many decades. Reader beware: This will likely fundamentally change your outlook on things if you are willing to actually take the time to understand this fraud. It may seem boring and of little interest to you right here and now, but I can assure you, if you want truth, you most likely won't want to put this down until you've completed the series. Let's begin with the 16th Amendment's claimed source for the income tax. If you take a look at page iii of the preface to the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, ( click here ), you will see reference to the now standing tax laws being enacted as far back as July 1, 1862, and carried forward to today. - Advertisement - Huge portions of our modern body of lawful ""income"" tax law pre-dates the 16th Amendment. Congress published a comprehensive ""Derivation of Code Sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and 1954"" table ( click here ), dated January 21, 1992, which explicitly identifies the pre-16th origins of these still-current statutes. (Highlighted sections within pages 20-76). It must also be noted that the 1986 Internal Revenue Code is based on these enactments and is still in place today. Throughout the Derivation table, you will see that there are well over 300 examples of the pre-1913 16th Amendment throughout, proving that the ""income"" tax was not ""enacted"" through the 16th Amendment. So, we now have to ask a couple questions and look for the plain answers in the record. The first question is ""If there is substantial evidence that the income tax was not ""enacted"" in 1913, and no such tax on American's wages existed (at least for very long as it was declared unconstitutional) prior to the 16th Amendment, what law actually authorizes a tax on American's wages?"" The answer is, there is no actual law. Is there supporting evidence of this fact? Let the U.S. Supreme Court tell us the facts from those days; ""The Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution has not enlarged the taxing power of Congress..."" This is brought out clearly by this court in Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 240 U.S. 1, and Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., 240 U.S. 103. ""We are of opinion, however, that the confusion is not inherent, but rather arises from the conclusion that the 16th Amendment provides for a hitherto unknown power of taxation; that is, a power to levy an income tax which, although direct, should not be subject to the regulations of apportionment applicable to all other direct taxes. And the far-reaching effect of this erroneous assumption will be made clear by generalizing the many contentions advanced in argument to support it."" Brushaber v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 240 U.S. 1, 11, 12, 18 (1916); ""In the former case it was pointed out that the all-embracing power of taxation conferred upon Congress by the Constitution included two great classes, one indirect taxes or excises, and the other direct taxes, and that of apportionment with regard to direct taxes. It was held that the income tax in its nature is an excise; that is, it is a tax upon a person measured by his income . . . It was further held that the effect of the Sixteenth Amendment was not to change the nature of this tax or to take it out of the class of excises to which it belonged, but merely to make it impossible by any sort of reasoning thereafter to treat it as a direct tax because of the sources from which the income was derived."" ([14-15]; Peck & Co. v. Lowe, 247 U.S. 165 (1917). Brief for the Appellant at 11, 14-15; See also Stratton's Independence, LTD. v. Howbert, 231 US 399, 414 (1913)."" (Emphasis added - ""derived from"" discussed below). ""... It manifestly disregards the fact that by the previous ruling it was settled that the provisions of the 16th Amendment conferred no new power of taxation."" Evans vs. Gore, 253 US 245, 263 (1920). ""It was not the purpose or effect of that amendment to bring any new subject within the taxing power."" Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., 271 U.S. 170; 46 S.Ct. 449 (1926). - Advertisement - ""... It manifestly disregards the fact that by the previous ruling it was settled that the provisions of the 16th Amendment conferred no new power of taxation."" Evans vs. Gore, 253 US 245, 263 (1920). ""It was not the purpose or effect of that amendment to bring any new subject within the taxing power."" Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., 271 U.S. 170; 46 S.Ct. 449 (1926); So, if there was no ""new"" tax created by the 16th Amendment, as the Supreme Court has stated over and over again, how can the IRS make our wages ""income"", and how did this tax on our wages begin? The answer comes within the second question we must ask: ""What exactly is 'income?'"" Here is where the deceit so easily enters out lives. U.S. v. Ballard, 535, 575 F. 2D 400 (1976); (see also Oliver v. Halstead, 196 VA 992; 86 S.E. Rep. 2D 858); ""The general term 'income' is not defined in the Internal Revenue Code . . .",1
