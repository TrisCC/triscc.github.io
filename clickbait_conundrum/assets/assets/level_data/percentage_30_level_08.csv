9405,Hezbollah says Kurdish vote a step toward wider Mideast partition,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The powerful Lebanese group Hezbollah said on Saturday that an Iraqi Kurdish independence vote marked a first step toward the partition of the Middle East, warning that this would lead to  internal wars  and must be opposed. Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, head of the Iran-backed group, said events in northern Iraq, where Kurds overwhelmingly voted for independence on Monday, were a threat to the whole region and not just Iraq and neighboring states with Kurdish populations.  It will open the door to partition, partition, partition,  Nasrallah said. He added that  partition means taking the region to internal wars whose end and time frame is known only to God . Nasrallah noted that his group s arch enemy Israel had come out in support of Kurdish statehood and described the referendum as part of a U.S.-Israeli plot to carve up the region. The United States came out in opposition to the vote, along with major European states and neighboring countries Turkey and Iran. The government of Syria, where Kurdish groups have established autonomous regions, also opposed the referendum. Nasrallah was speaking to supporters on the eve of Ashura, when Shi ites commemorate the slaying of the Prophet Mohammad s grandson, Imam Hussein, at Kerbala in 680 AD. Hezbollah, a political and military movement, is a major player in the Syrian conflict, where it has deployed thousands of fighters in support of President Bashar al-Assad. Hezbollah fighters are currently fighting along with other Iran-backed militias and the Syrian army against Islamic State militants in eastern Syria.  Daesh is at its end. It is a matter of time in Iraq and Syria,  Nasrallah said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. He said counter attacks mounted by Islamic State in eastern Syria in the last two days were expected as the group was besieged, adding that it was  incapable of recovering ground . ",0
45878, GOP Senator Incapable Of Answering This Simple Question About Trump’s Border Wall (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s proposal to build a wall between the United States and Mexico is absolutely ridiculous. It s unnecessary, counter-productive, and an insult to our national neighbor. The fact that Trump thinks that Mexico should foot the bill for the mega-project serves as the cherry on top of the giant pile of bullsh*t that Trump has served to his supporters insisting that it is made of ice cream.The proposal is just one of many elephants in the room that the GOP is refusing to give any coherent opinion on. That s why when Republican Senator Bob Corker appeared on ABC s This Week, the show s host George Stephanopoulos pressed the Senator for some clarity on the matter.Here s a transcript of the exchange:GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator, let me go ahead, let s talk about his ideas. You are the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and you ve said his call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration is not a serious proposal. The former head of the CIA Michael Hayden said this morning it s a recruiting tool for ISIS. If Donald Trump as president, moved to impose that ban would you support it or try to stop it?SEN. BOB CORKER No, I would not support it and I ve already issued statements to that effect and what I understand is he has stepped away from those statements.STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, he has said he still supports those statements. He s also said in every speech that he talks about building a wall on our border and getting Mexico to pay for it. Is that realistic and what would it do to our relations with Mexico?CORKER: You know, obviously we do need to have good relations with Mexico and Canada. We do. That s one of the things that makes our country in such a stable environment having two friends on our borders unlike many countries around the world. There is a security issue. I authored an amendment during the immigration debate that actually makes building a wall look like Ned in the first reader meaning it was even more difficult and by the way, I mean, a tougher security border measure   by the way, every Democrat in the Senate voted for that measure. So there s no question that we have agreement in our country that we need greater security. It s strongly bipartisan and I hope that we will implement that because it is a security threat.STEPHANOPOULOS: But is it realistic to expect Mexico to pay for the wall?CORKER: Again, I think people agree with that   what s that?STEPHANOPOULOS: Is it realistic for people to expect Mexico to pay for that wall?CORKER: Well, again, I don t want to get into a debate about the nuances of that. I mean it s a statement that he has made. I thought this interview was going to be more about the foreign policy arena. I think he has a tremendous opportunity there.STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, our relations with Mexico is foreign policy.CORKER: Okay. Well, look, as to how the wall is paid for, that s something that Congress certainly will debate. My guess is there will be additional debates regarding how the actual security measures will be put in place but securing our border has been something that people on both sides of the aisle have supported for years and we need to do that and it s understandable that it s become an issue because it s lingered for so long. We had an opportunity to deal with this years ago. It wasn t dealt with. Needs to be dealt with now. And hopefully we ll move beyond that very quickly.Surprise, surprise. No clear answers on one of the most important topics of the election cycle. If you can t answer a simple question about what may become part of your party s platform   it might be a good sign that it is time to jump off the ship.These days, it s looking more and more like top members of the Republican Party are embarrassed to be a member of that party. The Republican National Convention is coming up fast, sooner or later the GOP is going to have to decide if they are willing to go completely off the deep end and agree to support Trump s fascist proposals.You can watch the interview below.

17289,"Ugandan MPs get $8,000 each for work on extending president's rule: spokesman","KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan legislators have each pocketed 29 million Ugandan shillings ($8,000) as a payout for consultations on legislation to extend the president s rule, a parliamentary spokesman said on Tuesday, a move opponents denounced as a bribe.  The bill would scrap a constitutional age cap preventing President Yoweri Museveni, 73 and in power for 31 years, from standing in the next election. It is likely to pass, given the ruling party s majority, when it is voted on later this year.  A staunch ally of Western powers, Museveni is widely seen as an anchor of stability in the often volatile Great Lakes region after decades of violent Ugandan dictators. Critics say he has evolved into just another African strongman using corrupt and ruthless tactics to retain power for life.    Parliamentary spokesman Chris Obore said the one-off payment had been released to the legislators  bank accounts this week.   It s to help them to consult with their constituents on this bill,  he told Reuters.  MPs are among Uganda s best-paid public servants; their monthly remuneration of about $5,900 already includes expenses for regular travel to their constituencies to consult with voters. But low-paid public employees like teachers, police and health workers often do not see their salaries paid on time - typical delays can run to three months. Public hospitals are often missing important drugs.   Public anger over waste and corruption is growing, and protests have erupted in different parts of Uganda gainst the bill. Security forces have responded by using tear gas and live bullets to suppress the demonstrations.  Dozens of people have been arrested and two have died in the protests.  At the moment, Museveni cannot run for re-election in 2021 because the existing constitution bars candidates aged above 75 years of age. He backs the private member s bill, introduced in parliament last month, that seeks to scrap the age cap. The amendment, which critics say will clear the way for Museveni to rule for the rest of his life, has met broad resistance from some ruling party supporters, opposition, religious leaders and rights activists.   This is an outright bribe,  John Baptist Nambeshe, one of the MPs opposed to the bill, told Reuters.  To claim that it s a normal parliamentary facilitation - it defeats logic.  In total, the East African country is spending about 13 billion shillings ($3.55 million) to facilitate consultations on the bill by 445 legislators, Obore said.  In 2005, MPs were also offered a one-off payment of five million shillings to consult on a draft bill that removed a two-term cap on incumbency from the constitution, allowing Museveni to stand again. Each term is five years.  That was the only other occasion MPs have been paid to consult on a specific bill, and it also attracted wide criticism as a thinly-disguised bribe. The bill was passed.

46471,FRANCE: REFUGEE PAYS ANOTHER REFUGEE To Rape Worker As Pay Back For THIS,"No woman should be working in these public housing units where they re surrouded by men who are part of a culture where rape is a right.The 16-year-old adolescent, questioned and incarcerated on Saturday following the rape of a hotel employee in Orl an the previous week, says that he acted at a friend s request. These two unaccompanied minors, of African origin, were placed in this institution by the social assistance for children department of the local council.But one of the two adolescents apparently was very pressing towards the employee to the point where the young woman, in her 20s, ended up complaining about the sexual harassment she suffered each day. When alerted, the social services then decided to move the young man away and place him in the Children s institution in Orl ans.But he maintained his ties with his friend who remained in the hotel. The latter, after having taken flight, handed himself in on Thursday. Although he admitted the rape, and the premeditation   he called his victim a few minutes before the attack to ask for a clean towel, saying he would meet her not far from the laundry room   he insisted that he only acted at the request of his friend, who wanted to get revenge on the employee. He says he was promied  100 to commit the crime. Via:larep.fr",1
60198, Trump Can’t Decide Which Lie To Stick To Regarding His Claim That Obama Founded ISIS,"After all the backlash Trump received for saying that Obama was literally the founder of ISIS, he tried backpedaling, and then tried to backpedal off his backpedal (wait, what? Make a decision, fool). He first tried to lie his way out of it on Twitter, saying:Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton)  the founder  of ISIS, & MVP. THEY DON T GET SARCASM?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2016Because it s always the press that s out to get him, and not the press reporting on what he says. But that s beside the point. After that tweet, he held a rally in Erie, Penn., and he went back on that tweet: So I said the founder of ISIS,  Trump recalled to the crowd, after accusing the president of being  so weak and so bad  that he allowed the Islamic State to grow.  Obviously I m being sarcastic. Then   but not that sarcastic, to be honest with you.' Well, which is it, Your Royalness? Either you were being sarcastic or you meant what you said. Trump, however, really doesn t know what he s doing, and he will never admit that he was wrong to say something. When Hugh Hewitt asked him, point blank, whether he was talking about the vacuum created in Iraq by pulling our troops out, that exchange went like this:Trump: No, I meant he s the founder of ISIS. I do. He was the most valuable player. I gave him the most valuable player award. I gave her too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.Hugh Hewitt: But he s not sympathetic to them. He hates them. He s trying to kill them.Trump: I don t care, he was the founder. His, the way he got out of Iraq was that that was the founding of ISIS, okay.The only reason he s saying that was sarcasm now is because he was called on the carpet for it, and he has to cover his growing mountain of lies somehow. But it seems his loyal subjects might not have liked that as much, because he decided swerving back and forth on this was better than picking an opinion and sticking to it.Trump knows his campaign is in trouble. He s asked for help in Utah and Ohio, and also called for a meeting with the RNC to repair that relationship after more than fifty Republicans signed a letter to ask the RNC to pull his funding. Trump isn t going to change, though. He thinks he s invincible now that he s locked up the nomination, and has become so incapable of consistency that he can t even pick one lie and stick to it.Featured image by Regine Mahaux/Getty Images",1
46363, Hillary Reveals The ONE Person Who Made Her Lose… And It Isn’t Trump,"Hillary Clinton is speaking up after her election loss and coming forward with the facts on what contributed to the results. Despite the mainstream media s claims to the contrary, she points the finger at the extraordinary decision by FBI Director James Comey to interfere in the middle of the race. Just as we were back up on the upward trajectory, the second letter from Comey essentially doing what we knew it would saying there was no there there was a real motivator for Trump s voters,  Clinton said. Essentially, the second Comey letter played right into Trump s hands by giving new suspicions to those who believed the Washington establishment was helping Clinton win and pushed a surge in turnout.  Trump spent the last four days of this campaign engaged in a nonstop attack on me personally, and the result is the result,  Clinton said.The former presidential candidate also said she is  concerned  and  deeply saddened  for those who say they are living in fear in the United States after Trump s election.The decision by Comey was blasted by Democrats, and even some Republicans, as it gave the appearance that Clinton was still involved in wrongdoing, even though she had been previously cleared. It also fed into the mainstream media s obsession with Clinton s emails, which they covered more than nearly any other issue during the election.By contrast, Trump s refusal to release his tax returns hardly merited coverage, by comparison, nor did the shady dealings of his personal charity, the Trump Foundation.The press, in concert with the FBI and the right wing, weighed in on the election all against one candidate. While the right makes claims about  liberal media  bias, it is clear time and time again that they are weighing in on the behalf of the Republican side of the aisle and not the other.Featured image via Flickr",1

In what is being described as another ‘bizarre’ attempt to sabotage her own campaign, Hillary Clinton has desecrated a series of beloved US symbols, including punching a bison, setting fire to the Stars & Stripes and spitting at Jerry Seinfield. The Presidential hopeful seems determined to make a series of unprovoked errors, not least of which was agreeing to Bill hosting a sleepover for a group of Girl Guides. 
Short of dressing the Statue of Liberty in a Burka, Mrs Clinton has lurched from one PR blunder to another. Commented one journalist: ‘The Presidential race is entering the final furlong and if Mrs Clinton was horse – and before you can say Benghazi – she’s gone from bookie’s favourite to an ingredient at the local glue factory’. 
Having already become the unwitting focus of various health scares and FBI investigations, Mrs Clinton’s campaign is as orderly as a Marx Brothers movie. 
Her lead in the polls has been cut as video emerges of her lighting a cigar with a rolled up Bill of Rights, then proceeding to take a dump on the White House lawn.

18355,Red Cross says has access to Islamic State families held near Mosul,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Thursday it had access to more than 1,300 foreign wives and children of suspected Islamic State militants following concerns expressed for the safety of the families held by Iraqi forces near Mosul. The neutral aid agency called on all sides in the wars in Iraq and Syria to treat detainees in line with international law that prohibits torture or executions and enshrines the right to a fair trial. More than 300 of the detained foreign families in Iraq came from Turkey, many others from former Soviet states, such as Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and Russia, according to preliminary figures from the Iraqi army.  Currently we visit and provide humanitarian assistance to some 1,300 women and children of several dozen nationalities who are detained in Iraq near Mosul,  Patrick Hamilton, ICRC deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, told a news briefing. Last month, foreign aid agencies in Iraq said they were  gravely concerned  about the fate of the families. The women and children have been in Iraqi custody since August 30 following the fall of the city of Tal Afar.  It is the largest group of foreigners linked to Islamic State to be held by Iraqi forces since they began driving the militants from Mosul and other areas in northern Iraq last year. The ICRC denounced some authorities and militias in the Iraq and Syria wars against Islamic State who have vowed to  annihiliate  the enemy, but declined to name names. Such  dehumanisation  of the enemy could lead to unlawful torture or executions, Hamilton warned.  Talk of annihilation or extermination contributes to perpetuating the problem rather than solving it.  International humanitarian law protects civilians and former combatants, he said. The ICRC has a  good level of dialogue  with Iraqi authorities and has visited detention facilities in Iraq holding 44,000 people so far this year, Hamilton said. Thousands of foreigners have been fighting for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and an unknown number of them are now detained. Hamilton said the ICRC was already in talks about potential repatriation of foreign fighters.  We are ready to play the role of a neutral intermediary to assist these states in carrying out that, the return of their individual citizens,  he said.  Indeed we have been in dialogue with a number of different states and the Iraqi authorities in relation to this over recent weeks, he said. Hamilton, asked about media reports of executions by U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) following the fall of the jihadist capital in Raqqa, Syria, said that an ICRC team had been in the  chaotic  northeastern city last week.  No, we frankly don t have first-hand information in regards to extrajudicial killings or any such like ... clearly we remain concerned in the aftermath of Raqqa as we do after Mosul, Hawija, Tal Afar and so forth,  he said.

51893,Comment on Award Winning American Journalist Exposes The True Origin Of ISIS & The “War On Terror” by HILLARY CLINTON’S TIES TO ISIS SUPPORTERS | osmanisnin,"  “The statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception.” – Mark Twain ( source )   Award winning journalist Ben Swann shares a number of facts regarding the origin and creation of ISIS, the supposed terrorist group that seems to have replaced Al-Qaeda and, according to former FBI translator and founder of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition (NSWBC) Sibel Edmunds, has revived the “terror war industry.” When it comes to supposed “terrorist” attacks, it’s no secret that the government or the “powers that be” are involved in some way, shape, or form. We’ve seen this with Al-Qaeda, and various documents that have tied them to U.S. intelligence agencies like the CIA. We’ve also seen a lot of shady circumstances surrounding the “terrorist” attacks that occurred on 9/11; the evidence alone has approximately half of the American people believing it was an inside job – a simple Google search of the polls will show you that, and for the evidence we are referring to, you can access our articles on that topic here . “All three buildings were destroyed by carefully planned, orchestrated and executed controlled demolition.” – Professor Lynn Margulis, Department of Geosciences, University of Massachusetts at Amherst and National Academy of Science member, one of many academics who has been very outspoken regarding 9/11 ( source ) ( source ) All of this activity continues to be used as more justification for a heightened national security state, one in which citizens are being forced to give up their freedoms and privacy in order to be “protected” from such attacks. The entire national security state would crumble if people found out that it was their own government perpetrating these attacks, and this realization is finally beginning to leave the realm of conspiracy and enter into the realm of reality in the minds of the masses. It’s about time. “Most terrorists are false flag terrorists, or are created by our own security services. In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. In fact, we now have citizens taking out restraining orders against FBI informants that are trying to incite terrorism. We’ve become a lunatic asylum.” – David Steele, a 20-year Marine Corps intelligence officer, and the second-highest-ranking civilian in the U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence ( source )   The “terrorists” we are pointing our fingers at (or so I believe, along with many others, after having done careful research) are a creation of Western intelligence, used to justify the infiltration of other countries for ulterior motives. Those who usually do not believe that, almost one hundred percent of the time have not actually done any research, or examined the information for themselves. This is the power mainstream media has over us – if something is depicted on television, it’s instantly believed without question. Any other explanation which does not come from a major mainstream media outlet (like CNN, for example), or fit the framework of accepted knowledge, seems to be met with harsh resistance. This resistance comes despite the fact that a tremendous amount of evidence is available in the form of videos, documents, and whistle-blowers, yet a large majority of people still refuse to do any research for themselves, or again, believe something contrary to what Western media is telling them. “The truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called Al-Qaeda, and any informed intelligence officer knows this. But, there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an intensified entity representing the ‘devil’ only in order to drive TV watchers to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism. The country behind this propaganda is the United States.” – Former British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook

70595,Exclusive: Faulty devices help keep Iran in nuclear deal limits - report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Frequent breakdowns of advanced uranium enrichment devices have inadvertently helped Iran comply with restrictions in the international agreement curbing its nuclear program, according to a new report by a Washington-based think tank. Iranian compliance also is due to tougher policing by U.S. President Donald Trump s administration of the 2015 pact to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons, the Institute for Science and International Security said in a report due on Friday. A copy of the report was seen by Reuters.  Iran can be expected to continue to push the deal s limits, commit violations and seek interpretations that are unfounded,  the report said.  One should expect many struggles to keep Iran within the nuclear limits for the duration of the deal.  For those reasons and because Tehran is unlikely ever to build a financially viable uranium enrichment plant, an expansion of Iran s program would either be a  colossal waste of money ... or the basis of a nuclear weapons program, which would not care about costs,  the report said. Washington and its negotiating partners in the agreement should find a way to make the deal s restrictions permanent or  severely  extend their expiration times, it said. Under the deal between Iran, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, Tehran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for the lifting of economic sanctions that had crippled its economy.     The report comes as Trump weighs whether to certify to Congress that Iran is complying with the agreement. He has until Oct. 16 to make that decision.  Decertifying Iran could lead Congress to reimpose U.S. sanctions on Iran, threatening to collapse the deal and intensify tension in the Middle East. Supporters of the deal, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, insist that strong international monitoring will prevent Iran from developing nuclear bombs. Iran has denied that it is seeking nuclear weapons.   The International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the pact, has found no  material breaches  by Iran, a judgment with which Washington has concurred. Tehran has exceeded some deal restrictions, such as a limit on its heavy water stockpile, used in nuclear reactors, the Institute for Science and International Security said in a November 2016 report. But it either rectified some infractions or won exemptions - while President Barack Obama was in office - before the pact took effect in January 2016. In its new report the institute listed other alleged Iran compliance issues, including changes to the design of a heavy water reactor that can produce plutonium, another weapons fuel. Iran s improved compliance this year in part has been  unintentional or accidental  because advanced uranium enrichment devices called centrifuges have broken during testing more often than expected, according to the think tank report. Enrichment produces low-enriched uranium for power plants, but it also can make highly enriched weapons-grade uranium. By August, Iran had tested eight advanced IR-8 centrifuges although the deal limits it to one at most, the report said, adding that Iran also operated between 13 and 15 interconnected IR-6 machines, which the deal restricts to 10. However, according to the report, all but one of the IR-8s and many of the IR-6s broke because carbon fiber components failed. David Albright, a former U.N. nuclear inspector who authored the new report, said Iran s compliance also had improved because the United States is taking a tougher line on attempts to  violate the nuclear limits and exploit loopholes.    Two sources, including a senior U.S. official, said on Wednesday that the White House does not want to kill the deal.  Instead, it wants lawmakers to hold off taking action while it discusses with European allies making the limits on Iran s program permanent and fixing what U.S. officials consider other flaws, said the sources, who requested anonymity.

9703,CAN WE ADD DIRTY MONEY ‘LAUNDERING’ To The Obama $1.7 Billion Iran Ransom Payment?,"A member of the House Intelligence Committee is accusing the Obama administration of laundering some $1.7 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars to Iran through a complicated network that included the New York Federal Reserve and several European banks, according to conversations with sources and new information obtained by the lawmaker and viewed by the Washington Free BeaconNew disclosures made by the Treasury Department to Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.), a House Intelligence Committee member, show that an initial $400 million cash payment to Iran was wired to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) and then converted from U.S. dollars into Swiss francs and moved to an account at the Swiss National Bank, according to a copy of communication obtained exclusively by the Free Beacon.Once the money was transferred to the Swiss Bank, the  FRBNY withdrew the funds from its account as Swiss franc banknotes and the U.S. Government physically transported them to Geneva  before personally overseeing the handover to an agent of Iran s central bank, according to the documents. It looks as if the White House made just about every corner of the executive branch complicit in covering up the extent of its payments to Iran,  the source said.

(Fox News) President Obama’s high-security BlackBerry used a special process known as “whitelisting” that only allowed it to take calls and messages from pre-approved contacts, two former senior intelligence officials with knowledge of the set-up told Fox News – pointing to the detail as further proof the White House knew Hillary Clinton’s private account was used for government business. 
As the administration now acknowledges, Obama and Clinton emailed each other while she was helming the State Department. If received on his BlackBerry, the “whitelisting” safeguard means Clinton and other contacts would have had to be approved as secure for data transmission – covering everything from emails to texts to phone calls. The Obama BlackBerry would have also been configured to accept the communications. 
“Think of whitelisting like a bouncer in the VIP line at the party. If you are on the list you get in, if you are not, you get bounced to the pavement,” said Bob Gourley, former chief technology officer (CTO) for the DIA, and now a partner with strategic consulting and engineering firm Cognitio.",1
2381, Trump Vows That His Administration Will ‘Hire American’ And Twitter Rips Him Apart,"On Thursday, Donald Trump hopped on the Twitter Machine and made a promise to all Americans, tweeting out a graphic posted on his Instagram account: My Administration will follow two simple rules: BUY AMERICAN and HIRE AMERICAN! #USAA photo posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Dec 29, 2016 at 6:52am PSTTrump must have a very short memory because during the campaign it was revealed that his suits and ties, as well as a number of other products, are made in China (that s the country The Donald has been going out of his way to provoke as of late) or other countries. He appears to be blissfully unaware of his own long and storied history of hiring Mexican and other foreign workers. He also seems to be ignoring or somehow oblivious to the fact that his daughter, incoming First Lady Ivanka, was recently busted manufacturing her clothing in China, Indonesia, and Vietnam and the fact that his presidency was made in Russia.While the Trumps will say this is part of their mission to  make America great again,  Twitter jumped on the President- elect  for his hypocrisy:.@realDonaldTrump You have frequently hired foreign guest workers to fill jobs that could be completed by Americans https://t.co/Vhfe3nQnAf  Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 29, 2016.@realDonaldTrump Great slogan, sweetie!
