21692,Russian Military: US Coalition Predator Drone Spotted at Time & Place of Syria UN Aid Convoy Attack,"21st Century Wire says Despite proclamations by US official, details of the attack on the UN Aid Convoy yesterday are still sketchy. With no evidence to hand John Kerry and  unnamed  US officials claim that  they know  the Russian attacked the UN aid convoy passing through a  rebel  terrorist-held highway while travelling out of West Aleppo and heading southwest towards al-Foua and Kefraya villages. From the onset, both Russian and Syrian military stated they were not involved in this incident, but US maintain they are the guilty parties. John Kerry blaming Russia for mysterious attack on UN Convoy.The US insistence to blame Russia for attacking this UN Aid Convoy appears to be a desperate deflect-and-divert public relations move to mask the fact the Washington destroyed its own ceasefire agreement on Saturday when it massacred over 70 Syrian Army soldiers and wounding another 100, in a sustained one hour-long attack involving multiple aircraft from the US, UK, Australia and Denmark. Because of that US-led airstrike, ISIS was allowed to advance immediately forward towards taking the key strategic city of Deir al-Zour. In spite of the unlikely coincidence, Washington claimed this was all just  a mistake. In addition, US Coalition and Gulf-backed  rebel  terrorists had already broke the Russia-US ceasefire multiple times, and are also on record boasting earlier in the week how terrorist-held East Aleppo militants would refuse any UN aid convoy that crossed their sights.Did the US and its  rebel  forces on the ground orchestrate another false flag event designed to avoid condemnation of Saturday s massacre? Our western colleages are putting their best efforts to hype up the situation and  blur  the tragedy in Deir ez-Zor and to distract the international community from Al-Nusra s advance on Aleppo and thus cover the US incompetence in distinguishing between the  moderate  opposition and terrorists in Syria.    Russian spokeperson.Now, new evidence suggests that the US Coalition may be misleading the world about their true intentions  RTThe Russian Defense Ministry says that a US coalition drone was in the vicinity of a humanitarian convoy when it was attacked outside Aleppo. According to the Russian military, the unmanned aircraft was a Predator drone. On the evening of September 19, in that specific region, a drone belonging to the international condition, which had taken off from the Incirlik air base in Turkey, was flying at a height of 3,600 meters and traveling at around 200 kilometers per hour,  said Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov. The object was in the area around the town of Urm Al-Kubra, where the convoy was a few minutes before it caught fire,  Konashenkov added.  It left after about 30 minutes. The Defense Ministry spokesman said he wanted to point out that, as was the case with the tragedy on September 17 which saw US-led coalition airstrike kill and injure 200 people, the Russians would not be making any unfounded allegations. Only the owners know what exactly the drone was doing at this particular area at that exact time,  he added.Moscow says it has provided all the data it possesses regarding the attack on the convoy, which was carrying aid to rebel-held areas in Aleppo, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday. There was another unacceptable provocation on September 19   the shelling of a humanitarian convoy near Aleppo,  he said.  I am confident that such coincidences require serious analysis and an investigation. On September 19, a humanitarian convoy consisting of 31 trucks was attacked while heading to Aleppo. According to the Red Cross, 20 civilians and one aid worker died as a result. Initial reports claimed the convoy had been targeted by an airstrike. Later the UN said all it could confirm was that the convoy was attacked.On Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry reiterated that neither it nor the Syrian military had launched airstrikes on the convoy. Russian and Syrian warplanes did not carry out any airstrikes on a UN humanitarian aid convoy in the southwest of Aleppo,  Konashenkov said in a statement. He added that the military had studied video footage of the convoy, which appeared to rule out that an airstrike took place. We have closely studied the video footage from where the incident took place and we did not find any signs of any ammunition having hit the convoy. There are no craters, while the vehicles have their chassis intact and they have not been severely damaged, which would have been the case from an airstrike,  Konashenkov said. All of the video footage demonstrates that the convoy caught fire, which strangely happened almost at exactly at the same time as militants started a large-scale offensive on Aleppo. In a statement Konashenkov said Moscow was compelled to disclose the  sensitive details  in response to the accusations made by US deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes, who has laid the blame for the attack on the aid convoy on Russia. This type of drone can not only monitor the situation, but also guide ground weapons to their targets and inflict surgical airstrikes at objects located on the ground by itself,  the Russian spokesman explained Read more at RTREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria Files",1
51450,Israeli Deputy Minister: Italy Quakes Retribution For Anti Jewish Vote,"  Edmondo Burr in Conspiracies // 0 Comments The two earthquakes that hit Italy Wednesday were “ retribution ” for the country’s support of a UNESCO resolution that disregards the Jewish connection to Jerusalem and the Temple Mount, according to Israeli Deputy Minister Ayoob Kara (Likud). 
Israel suspended its ties with the UN cultural agency after it adopted a draft resolution this month, that Israel says denies Judaism’s connections to the religion’s holiest sites. 
The deputy minister, who was in Italy when the earthquakes struck, ascribed the natural disasters to divine will. 
RT.com reports: 
“ I’m sure that the earthquake happened because of the UNESCO decision, ” Kara, a member of the ruling Likud Party, wrote in a memo, Ynetnews website reported. 
Ironically, the Israeli politician was on a state visit to the Vatican when the quakes hit central Italy on Wednesday, killing one and injuring 10 people. 
Earlier the same day, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), passed a resolution criticizing Israel for its handling of the holy site in Jerusalem – called Temple Mount by Jews, and Haram al-Sharif by Muslims. 
The document was adopted after heated debate over its wording, and particularly the Arabic names used in the document. Italy was among the nations voting in favor of the resolution. 
Israel blasted UNESCO and its Arab members for trying to undermine Jewish connections to the holy site. 
Kara arrived in the Vatican in a fruitless effort to avert the resolution, but still managed to have a small chat with the leader of the Catholic Church. 
According to Kara, Pope Francis “ strongly disagreed ” with the resolution. 
“ He (the Pope) even said publicly that the holy land is connected to the Nation of Israel, ” the deputy minister stressed. 
As for surviving the natural disaster, the Israeli politician said that “ going through the earthquake was not the most comfortable of experiences, but we trusted that the Holy See would keep us safe. ”",1
10036,SHOCK VIDEO: Hillary Supporters ATTACK Homeless Woman Protecting Trump’s Star,"Posted by Chris Menahan “Trump Supporter gets what she’s been asking for… A Beatdown from a Latina.” 
Shocking video out of California shows Hillary Clinton supporters violently attack a homeless woman who was doing all she could to defend Donald Trump’s Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
Friday, newly surfaced video shared by one of Hillary Clinton’s Hillbullies shows an Hispanic thug lay his hands on the brave woman and steal her signs, all while shouting “GET YOUR ASS OUTTA HERE, B*TCH!” 
Other Hillbullies are then seen spitting on her signs and stomping them with their feet. 
As the innocent woman is seen frantically trying to protect herself from the terrorist thug, he violently trips her to the ground. 
Hillary supporting onlookers are then seen chastising her and as she lay motionless. 
“Didn’t I tell you, about five minutes ago, that somebody was going to walk by here — and no I won’t defend you — because you spewed hate, and you got hate,” one Hillbully says. “You got exactly what you were dishing out, I told, I warned you on that, didn’t I?” 
The YouTube video, which was shared by user “Koali Fikator,” has this sickening description: “After Bullying Everyone, Trump Supporter gets what she’s been asking for… A Beatdown from a Latina.” 
All the woman did was hold up signs saying she wants to put Americans first: 
She didn’t assault anyone, she merely exercised her right to free speech as an American! 
These left-wing terrorists used violence to suppress her free speech simply because she supports Donald Trump for president! That’s the definition of terrorism! 
Get this story out to everyone so they can see how these Hillbullies operate! . @ScottAdamsSays : ""I can't vote for a bully."" So he endorses Trump. The #Hillbullies have made violence against Trump supporters legitimate. pic.twitter.com/4nVscp6mki

66321,"On 9/11 Anniversary, Somber Reflections on Lives, and a World, Changed - The New York Times","With the ringing of a bell, the thousands who gathered in Lower Manhattan fell silent on Sunday, and all that could be heard was the water cascading in the reflecting pools where the World Trade Center towers once stood. It was 8:46 a. m. the moment when, 15 years earlier, a plane struck the north tower. Family members of the victims bowed their heads, some crying and embracing, while others stood tall, looking up at the overcast skies. About 8, 000 people crowded the National September 11 Memorial plaza at the World Trade Center for what has become an annual ritual: the reading of the names of the 2, 977 people killed in the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001, and of the six killed in the bombing of the World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993. With the 15th anniversary falling on a Sunday, people turned out for the ceremony in much larger numbers than in previous years. But for the family members of the victims, it was another year of grief, and the pain was as raw as ever. “It feels like it’s been 15 seconds,” said Tom Acquaviva, whose son, Paul, died while working in the north tower. He was 29 years old, “too young,” Mr. Acquaviva said. Classical string music played as mothers, fathers, siblings, children and other relatives read the names, one by one. Some paused to say a few words to their loved ones others offered updates on graduations, weddings and other milestones during the past 15 years. The bell tolled five more times: at 9:03, when a plane struck the south tower at 9:37, when a plane hit the Pentagon at 9:59, when the south tower collapsed at 10:03, when a hijacked plane crashed in Shanksville, Pa. after passengers staged a revolt and at 10:28, when the other tower fell. Both presidential candidates, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton, attended the ceremony, though neither made public remarks and both agreed not to campaign for the day. A spurt of cheers welcomed Mr. Trump just before the ceremony started. An hour and a half into the ceremony, Mrs. Clinton felt overheated and left to rest in her daughter’s Manhattan apartment, according to a statement released by her campaign. Around 11:40 a. m. she emerged from the apartment building on her own, waved to onlookers and said she was “feeling great. ” At the Pentagon, President Obama delivered his last address commemorating the 184 victims there, and while his words were similar to remarks he has given before, they were a clear rebuke to the divisive rhetoric coursing through the presidential campaign. Mr. Obama said that after the attacks, it was important for the country to defend not only its territory, “but also our ideals. ” He said that groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State know that they cannot defeat a nation such as the United States, so their attacks are intended to cause fear that leads Americans to turn on one another and “change who we are or how we live. ” “And that’s why it is so important today that we reaffirm our character as a nation  —   a people drawn from every corner of the world, every color, every religion, every background  —   bound by a creed as old as our founding, e pluribus unum,” Mr. Obama said. Mr. Obama has previously expressed his opposition to proposals by Mr. Trump to ban Muslim immigration. Mr. Obama said that those kinds of proposals undermined the foundations of American democracy, which was why on Sunday he translated the Latin phrase that remains on the seal of the United States. “Out of many, we are one,” he said. “For we know that our diversity  —   our patchwork heritage  —   is not a weakness it is still, and always will be, one of our greatest strengths. This is the America that was attacked that September morning. This is the America that we must remain true to. ” In Shanksville, about 1, 000 people attended the annual service at the Flight 93 National Memorial, honoring the 40 passengers and crew members who died there, The Associated Press reported. The site, about 60 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, is where the United Airlines flight crashed as passengers stormed the cockpit. Addressing the victims’ families, Sally Jewell, the secretary of the interior, said, according to The A. P.: “You have known the terrible pain of loss. None of us would want to trade places with you, but we honor your sacrifice. ” About halfway through the ceremony in Manhattan, the sun began to peer through the clouds, beaming on the new 1 World Trade Center. During a moment of silence at 10 a. m. a woman cried as she faced the building, and a firefighter passed her a packet of tissues. The woman, Kristen Alverson, 55, said she was thinking about her close friends Edward James Day, 45, and Richard John Kelly Jr. 50, both firefighters with Ladder Company 11 who served alongside her husband, who survived. “At that moment,” she said, “so many people perished. ” Danielle Kousoulis, 29, a bond broker, was in her office at the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald in the north tower on Sept. 11. Just before Ms. Kousoulis died, her sister said, she knew that the south tower had fallen and feared that her building would be next. She called her boyfriend twice, but refrained from calling others to let her   use her phone. “Sometimes it feels like it was just yesterday sometimes it feels like it was forever ago,” said her sister, Eleni Kousoulis, 46, of Philadelphia. Her mother, Zoe Kousoulis, 76, wore a   necklace with her daughter’s picture on it. She said the only good that came from the attacks was that Eleni met her husband, who is in the Navy, through a   event. “I always say Danielle sent him to her,” Zoe Kousoulis said. The passage of time was evident by the children who spoke at the ceremony. Many had never known their relatives. Valerie Arnold, 12, did not meet her uncle, Michael Boyle, 37, a firefighter with Engine Company 33. She said she found it hard to wrap her mind around the attacks, not having lived through them herself. But she said she has begun to understand, thanks to stories told by her grandfather, a retired firefighter who came to Lower Manhattan to help that day. “It’s crazy how people would do such a terrible thing,” she said. After all the names were read and the crowds started to disperse, Yvonne Davis Rogers, 52, stayed behind to spend a quiet moment at a reflecting pool, where her brother’s name is engraved. She traced his name, Clinton Davis, onto a long white piece of paper. Mr. Davis, 38, was an officer with the Port Authority Police Department. “Just being here, it makes it better,” Ms. Davis Rogers, who lives in Pennsylvania, said. “This encourages me to keep going. ”",0
22924,My Response To The Student In My Class Who Said 'Uneducated White Men Shouldn't Be Able To Vote',"Share on Twitter IJR Opinion is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of IJR. 
You ask, “Why Trump?” From your college classrooms, comfortable suburban homes and your summer lakeside retreats in quaint New England towns, you wonder why. 
While in class the professor comments, “Well, the main supporters of Trump are uneducated white males.” You, a new age liberal sympathizer - and my classmate - blurt out, “Uneducated white males shouldn’t have the right to vote!” 
Is this the college experience I signed up for? I know I'm the type of person liberals like you disdain; I've spent about half my years on this earth working blue collar jobs: logging, haying, septic work, farming, stacking stone walls. I've owned two 1940s era tractors. You don't know what true labor is. I do - I was born and bred into this lifestyle. 
All over this land, alarms go off before the dawn. You may work from 9 to 5 in a cozy office, but for the working class the day stretches from dawn to dusk. Sometimes it takes two or more jobs to make ends meet. “Work hard and you will be rewarded,” says the world. But those with the most wealth have only found ways to make others work hard for them. 
Although I have chosen to not cast my ballot for the Republican ticket this time around, I have empathy for those who will - those whom you, modern liberalism, created. You outsource businesses and you coddle illegal immigrants who drive down the cost of labor - and therefore the benefits of a job. You, the rich, liberal elite, have taken advantage of those whose backs you live upon. You gutted them, you skinned them, you left them to hang like a deer carcass to bleed out. 
On top of it all, you say people like me are “white trash,“”standard rednecks“ and “dirty hicks.” The champions of social justice that attend my liberal arts college in rural Vermont call us “dirty townies."" 
We grow your food, we transport your food, we build your homes and we keep them maintained - and yet we are snubbed. We plow the roads, fix the power lines and drive semi-trucks so that you can live a life of convenience. You cut our wages and our hours - yet you say we don’t work hard enough. 
Since I was 12, I have worked for both rich Republicans and rich Democrats. At least the rich Republicans don't preach all that Democrats do to save the world - while paying me dirt. Few of those who support Hillary Clinton have had to awaken at 3:45 A.M. to start a chainsaw in the dim light of dawn, to work a job where either that chainsaw, a wood chipper, or a falling tree could kill them any day - for the reward of $12 an hour, no less. What is the working man’s death worth to those with millions? 
You distract us with the media and you harp on racism, sexism and the insignificant. Where in your agenda is there time for the growing class struggle, the death of family farming, and the tearing of the fabric of rural New England life? You swoop in from elsewhere to buy the land, gentrify the towns, and reduce the local population to the same status as the English peasant after the enclosure movement . 
You speak of social programs, give to those who do nothing, give every child a trophy and shelter them from the realities of the world. You talk of raising taxes that the rich somehow never pay. You would rather take a loaf of bread from the working stiff to support the unemployed or those who drink away a college education. 
The question at hand should not be, “Why Trump?” The question at hand should be why you drove those who support him into a hole and then tied their hands behind their backs. You want them to support the broken system that gave you, not them, the benefit. Soon, you won’t have to worry about them supporting Trump; rum-filled farmers, a rabble in arms... 
Those whom you called a “ basket of deplorables ” are the same stock that brought America into being. Yet, raise taxes, you say. Raise the cost of living, of each and every good that is bought and sold. The resulting burden will only fall upon those who labor their lives away, to struggle to exist, who always will. ",1
32791,Trump Vowed to Protect the Safety Net. What if His Appointees Disagree? - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Two days before Election Day, Donald J. Trump traveled to Sioux City, Iowa, and proclaimed that he was the protector of federal programs aimed at helping elderly and   Americans. It was Hillary Clinton, he said, who was an untrustworthy steward of the working class and who would slash vital benefits. “I am going to protect and save your Social Security and your Medicare,” Mr. Trump said. “You made a deal a long time ago, a long time ago. ” The pledge followed earlier promises to enact a new    benefit and not to make cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. When President Trump addresses Congress this Tuesday and follows the speech with a budget blueprint for the fiscal year that begins in October, his White House will finally address in concrete numbers one of his central contradictions: He campaigned as the populist protector of programs for the working class, yet he has pledged to control the budget deficit, cut spending and cut taxes. Moreover, Mr. Trump has surrounded himself with traditional   conservatives bent on cutting back or eliminating many of the programs he has championed. Many of his aides and cabinet members have expressed views that are fundamentally opposed to those he campaigned on. Former Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, for example, the new White House budget director, has called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme” and helped engineer a government shutdown to cut spending. As House Budget Committee chairman, Tom Price, the new secretary of health and human services, supported converting Medicaid to strictly capped block grants to the states and turning Medicare into a voucherlike program for future recipients. Ben Carson, the president’s nominee to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has repeatedly said government programs to help the poor lead to dependency. The disparity between Mr. Trump’s rhetoric and his appointments has cheered many Republicans and left Democrats fearing that he will not only renege on his promises to protect the government’s largest entitlement programs but that he will also slash programs he did not mention on the campaign trail that offer food, housing and child care support for the poor. “The appointments that he’s made are troublesome and very, very scary,” Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, said. “He made a pledge and sort of delineated himself from the rest of the Republican field by saying these things. Everything he’s done since he’s been elected is very worrisome. ” Already, Mr. Trump’s budget office has hinted at cuts to come in a memo that singled out the Legal Services Corporation, which helps the poor manage legal issues, and the Appalachian Regional Commission, which targets economic development in some of the poorest parts of the country. The memo also said that AmeriCorps, a program that puts volunteers into poor communities, would be zeroed out, and that the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a nonprofit organization focused on urban development, would see its budget cut substantially. On Capitol Hill, some Republicans are hoping Mr. Mulvaney and others will change the president’s mind on far bigger targets and convince him that structural changes to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid  —   the biggest drivers of deficits that are projected to rise over the next decade  —   are needed to control the national debt and to preserve the programs without substantial tax increases. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid consumed nearly $1. 9 trillion of the government’s $3. 9 trillion in spending in 2016, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and with the number of people 65 and over projected to rise by a third over the next decade, Social Security and Medicare spending is projected to increase from a third of all spending in 2017 to 42 percent by 2027. Including Medicaid and military and federal civilian retirement benefits, federal spending on older adults will rise from 37 percent of outlays in 2017 to 45 percent in 2027 if nothing is done to change the programs. Even some liberal economists say that will amount to a transfer of funds from poor children and families toward   older Americans, because the budget office projects that discretionary spending  —   where most programs for poor families come from  —   will be squeezed from 6. 3 percent of the economy now to 5. 3 percent in 2027, the smallest level since 1962. With those numbers on their side, Republicans are most likely to use their power in both the executive and legislative branches to push through large cuts to federal programs for poor and   Americans, say Democrats and liberal policy analysts  —   if Mr. Trump eases up on his promises. “This is the greatest threat to   people in my lifetime,” said Olivia Golden, executive director of the Center for Law and Social Policy, a nonprofit organization focused on   Americans. House Republican allies see no real contradiction in Mr. Trump’s campaign promises and what they say he must now do. Since President George W. Bush’s failed 2005 effort to partially privatize Social Security, Republicans have assured retirees and those nearing retirement that any changes or cuts to entitlement programs for older adults would not affect them. Now, Republicans are retroactively applying those caveats to Mr. Trump’s promises, saying the president understands that programs like Social Security and Medicare must be maintained for Americans who are currently receiving benefits but must be changed for younger Americans who may have to work longer before retiring and getting benefits. “It was really about making sure that those people who are getting benefits or about to get benefits are protected,” said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and a leader of the   conservative House Freedom Caucus. “If we do nothing, he will not save Medicare and Social Security. ” Representative Jeff Duncan, Republican of South Carolina, said he would be closely watching his former Freedom Caucus colleague, Mr. Mulvaney, as he settles in to work at the Office of Management and Budget. “I’m curious to see how Mick Mulvaney approaches this from O. M. B. because he is very   with us here,” Mr. Duncan said. In fact, on the campaign trail and in interviews before the election, Mr. Trump did not suggest that he would maintain the programs in their current form only for older Americans. His rallies were attended by a   of ages, who cheered his broad promises. And last March, Mr. Trump said during a debate among Republican presidential candidates that he planned to make no changes. “I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is,” Mr. Trump said. “I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. ” The pressure to break that promise will come not only from congressional Republicans but also from his own campaign pledges to build a wall along the Mexican border, increase spending on defense, border security and infrastructure, cut taxes “big league” and control the deficit. “The last time we saw this kind of budgetary logic was at the beginning of the Reagan administration when he came into office, pledged to beef up defense spending and cut taxes,” said William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former aide to President Bill Clinton. “They tried to keep the spending increases down and the deficit increases down by whacking away at social safety net programs, many of which were cut during that period. ” Even if Mr. Trump keeps his promise not to touch Social Security and Medicare, other programs like housing subsidies, child care assistance, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, could be cut, social welfare and budget analysts say. And those cuts would not just affect poor minority voters, who tend to support Democratic candidates. A study released this month by the   Center on Budget and Policy Priorities research group shows that white   adults without a college degree, a critical voting block for Republicans, benefit the most from social safety net programs and   benefits. “My fear is that we are going to see the biggest cuts that any president has ever proposed in programs for   and   families,” said Bob Greenstein, the center’s president. “It could be the biggest Robin Hood in reverse a president has ever offered. ”",0

24143,"Martha’s Vineyard, Off-Season - The New York Times","“You live on Martha’s Vineyard year round?” It’s a question I’ve been asked many times since I moved here from New York some 20 years ago. Sometimes I sense envy behind the question, sometimes pity. Do I live in bucolic bliss? Have I found solace in nature, a simplified,   existence? Or perhaps my inquisitors imagine me in one of those paintings of a lonely lighthouse, furious waves breaching the rocks, while the lighthouse keeper stoically rides the storm. Or perhaps they see a marooned Tom Hanks with only a volleyball face for a friend. The choice to live   on an island seven miles off Cape Cod is an unconventional one. But of course, life here in the   has the routines we all juggle: Take the kids to school, walk the dog, shop for dinner. A musician by trade, I’ve managed to carve out a living on Martha’s Vineyard as a bandleader, and my wife runs an   dance program. Years ago, we purchased the Old Martha’s Vineyard   Dairy in Edgartown. “Heck of a wreck,” the ad read   years of neglect had left the rambling old farm building and its Ma ’n’   additions in disrepair: toppled chimney, leaky roof, caving walls, rotted windows. But we managed to renovate the property to include summer rental cottages and have raised two children here. People are sometimes surprised to learn that Martha’s Vineyard is approximately four times the size of Manhattan, with six towns and four distinct villages within them. Oak Bluffs, Edgartown and Vineyard Haven are referred to as “down island,” and Chilmark, West Tisbury and Aquinnah are “up island. ” The “up” and “down” do not refer to north and south but to the westerly   coordinates. (When whaling ships sailed the globe, heading “up,” in nautical terms, actually took you west.) Down island is more densely populated, and Edgartown, particularly, retains the flavor of the whaling industry, with its sea captains’ homes and bustling mercantile feel. Up island is more bucolic, with spectacular beaches, farms and wooded trails. Vineyard life follows a seasonal rhythm all its own. In summer, the   population of 15, 500 swells to 115, 000, creating a hectic pace. Only a quick wave was offered as I passed an old friend last August, his gesture conveying a familiar sentiment: Too busy to talk we’ll catch up in the fall when things settle down. The Steamship Authority’s ferries unload a steady stream of cars brimming with white coolers and colorful beach supplies. Traffic on the   roads slows to a crawl. Fall is the prize the thick, hazy air of summer is gone, yet it is still warm enough for a swim well into October. The summer crowds  —   presidential guests, Hollywood stars and their entourages, seasonal residents and vacationers  —   have mostly vanished. The pace slows gracefully. Locked gates to private beaches swing open, restaurants like Offshore Ale, Martha’s Vineyard Chowder Company and the Wharf Pub fill with locals. Ample time to linger now for a chat. Winter dulls the landscape as green meadows turn beige and amber, and the ubiquitous twisted scrub oaks, leafless, appear stark and naked, hunched over like weathered old witches clutching broomstick and cane. Edgartown’s overflowing flower boxes are empty, cedar beach houses shuttered. The ferry is our lifeline to the mainland, to goods, supplies, mail, just about everything.   it runs from 6 a. m. till 8:30 p. m. 9:45 on weekends. But when the winds kick up past 50 miles per hour, the ferries shut down. News of canceled boats quickly disseminates at coffee shops and checkout lines. Bar talk of a pending storm prompts the question: “Think they’ll be canceling boats tomorrow?” There are few cocktail parties and no beach cookouts in winter, but plenty of potluck dinners with friends and neighbors, many of them teachers, police officers, artists, writers, musicians, restaurant workers and tradespeople fueled by the   cycle of build, renovate, paint and restore. Commercial fishermen still ply the waters for lobster, bay scallops, conch and fin fish. However, their numbers have dwindled because of diminishing fish stocks, regulatory issues and the rising cost of living on the island, which is about 70 percent above the national average, according to a study  by the Martha’s Vineyard Commission. Roughly 20 percent of the   population is Brazilian immigrants. Portuguese is, in fact, a second language on the island. Each year as the season comes to an end I keep a close eye on the weather, watchful for a fair day to haul my boat out of the water. One early December morning, the sun created a crisp, presolstice light blues were a bit bluer, and what greenery remained seemed greener. It had been such a mild fall that I’d left the boat in the water longer than usual, but winter was approaching, and I knew that hauling even my   and its   mooring and chain would only become harder. From Edgartown I steered my pickup toward Oak Bluffs via Beach Road, empty boat trailer in tow, my golden retriever, Bella, riding shotgun. Beach Road is a narrow,    strip across the dunes. State Beach was on my right, the   tidal pond named Sengekontacket on my left. (The Wampanoag name means “at the bursting forth of the tidal stream. ”) The Beach Road and its two bridges deliver a different view from day to day, hour to hour. In summer, the bridge’s rail is lined with bathers poised for a   jump into the channel between tidal pond and sea. In the fall, fishermen cast in the moving waters of the channel below for striped bass or bluefish others rake for clams in the adjacent shallow pond. In the heart of the winter, the   sea is gray, sluggish waves too heavy to crest, whitecaps crashing against the pilings and jetties. The first stop that December morning was Mocha Mott’s coffee shop in Oak Bluffs. The former owner, Mott Hinckley, arrived in 1994 and opened this premium coffee shop, determined to operate it 365 days a year. A second shop soon opened in Vineyard Haven. Holiday lights were strung around chalkboard menus offering soups, sandwiches and breakfast items, and the heart pine floor cast a warm glow. No Starbucks to compete with here. In fact, you won’t find many chain stores islanders have successfully fought them off. McDonald’s tried to brandish its golden arches back in 1978, but that Goliath was chased away. While many shops, restaurants and bars are closed for the winter, a few remain open. Other winter breakfast spots are Linda Jean’s in Oak Bluffs (classic eggs, toast and home fries) and the venerable Black Dog Tavern, whose tables face Vineyard Haven Harbor, where one can watch for the ferry. Night life, too, is an   option. In the winter live music, from jazz to blues to   to a weekend dance band play on at the Newes From America pub in Edgartown and, in Oak Bluffs, Park Corner, Offshore Ale Company, and most notably the Ritz Cafe, with live music five nights a week. Coffee in its holder, I headed up island toward Chilmark, on   Tisbury Road. On the right was the state forest and its wooded bike path. (An extensive bike path now covers most of the island.) At the triangle at the end of the road, I took a left and drove past Alley’s General Store, where you’ll find a bit of everything, from snacks and hardware to novelty items like emergency underpants in a can and   racecars. Beyond Alley’s, I took a right on Music Street, then a left onto Middle Road, where I twisted and turned under the gnarled tree canopy that filtered the crisp winter light. There is a farm stand on that road with amazing cheese, bread and yogurt drinks. A tin can acts as cash register the honor system prevails here.   of the way down Middle Road I slowed to take in a breathtaking view that hasn’t changed since I was a teenager: vivid green rolling hills stretching for miles, past a small pond then down to the south shore. It could be Ireland or Scotland. This   parcel known as Keith Farm has been preserved through the efforts of Vineyard Open Land Foundation. Other conservation groups are engaged in preservation, perhaps most notably the Martha’s Vineyard Land Bank, which has acquired more than 3, 000 acres. I continued past the Chilmark Store, closed for the winter, where locals and Hollywood’s best provision their August beach excursions. A mile up the road I backed my trailer down the ramp to Quitsa Pond’s town landing, where I’ve moored my boat for two decades. After a quick kayak trip to my boat’s mooring, I cranked the engine and was off, cruising through the meandering tidal ponds to Menemsha, where I would top off the boat’s gas tank. Menemsha, still an active fishing hamlet, has a New England coastal feel from days long past. One glance in the right direction and time warps back to the 1940s. Weatherworn   shacks, perched on the exposed strip of Dutcher’s Dock, house the gear and tackle of what remains of Menemsha’s   fishing fleet. Summer’s wooden sailboats and small yachts flee for warmer climates in the fall in winter, Menemsha is still home port to a dozen weathered lobster boats and a small fleet of draggers and scallop boats. I filled my tank at the gas dock, then navigated toward Quitsa Pond’s town landing, my final trip for the season. I hauled my boat with little fuss, and steered the truck back down island on South Road with a boat on my tail and lunch on my mind. Adjacent to Alley’s is a breakfast and lunch spot called 7a its name is derived from Martha’s Vineyard’s position on the Department of Agriculture’s plant hardiness zone map. The porch here is a social gathering spot, and I often sit down for lunch and end up having company. The Liz Lemon sandwich (named for Tina Fey’s character on “30 Rock”) is a Reubenesque fantasy in which pastrami, turkey, Swiss, coleslaw, Russian dressing and crumbled potato chips somehow fuse seamlessly between slices of toasted rye. I finished my lunch and headed back down island with the afternoon sun in my rearview mirror. I set my boat in its winter resting place next to an old twisted pear tree in our backyard, its bent branches a reminder of winter winds to come. I’ve become accustomed to the seasonal pace on Martha’s Vineyard. Though I can’t claim to have achieved bucolic bliss, I have enjoyed solace in nature. When winter storms rage, I am sometimes reminded of that stalwart light keeper, but in my 20 years here I’ve never felt marooned. Like the ebb and flow of the tidal ponds, my final cruise marks the flow from fall to winter. And winter’s low tide anticipates the flood tide of spring, with the promise of summer on its heels.",0
16482,SHOUT! POLL: Do the ‘White Helmets’ Qualify for a Nobel Peace Prize?," 21st Century Wire asks Currently throughout the western media exists a major public relations push to raise the profile of supposed  NGO  in Syria known as the  White Helmets  in advance of the upcoming Nobel Peace Prize award on Oct 7th in Oslo, Norway. Recently, streaming giant Netflix released a documentary film to much fanfare, about this alleged  first responder  group in Syria called the White Helmets. They produce many of the emotional images seen on western media about the Syrian conflict, and also claim to have saved 60,000 lives from  Assad s bombs  since 2013. What many people are not aware of, however, is that this group has been financed by NATO member states to the tune of at $60 million so far, and they are embedded exclusively in terrorist-held areas of Syria.

36709,Mattis says U.S. military policy in Syria unchanged,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday that the United States’ military policy in Syria had not changed and remains focused on defeating Islamic State militants even after the United States launched 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield last week.  “The goal right now in Syria, and the military campaign is focused on accomplishing that, is breaking ISIS, destroying ISIS in Syria,” Mattis said at a Pentagon press briefing, using an acronym for Islamic State. He added that there was no doubt that the Syrian government was responsible for a poison gas attack and it had used chemical weapons several times in the past.  ",0
53203,The Daily 202: What Trump’s latest shakeup says about his flailing campaign,"THE BIG IDEA: Shaking up his campaign once again, Donald Trump has decided to let Trump be Trump.

The Republican nominee knows he’s losing. Congenitally unable to take personal responsibility, he blames his slide in the polls on the people who have prodded him to act “presidential” and wage a more traditional campaign.

In a 5:38 a.m. press release, Trump announced that Stephen Bannon, who got rich on Wall Street but has never worked on a race before, will take a leave of absence from running Breitbart.com to become the campaign’s “chief executive.” Pollster Kellyanne Conway, who worked for Ted Cruz’s super PAC during the primaries but has been friendly with Trump for years, will become campaign manager.

Paul Manafort will retain his titles as campaign chairman and chief strategist, but Trump advisers told Robert Costa overnight that his status has diminished internally due to the candidate’s unhappiness and restlessness in recent weeks. The aides told Costa that Trump has grown to feel “boxed in” and ""controlled"" by people who barely know him.

Trump plans to redouble his focus on holding big rallies and doing lots of TV hits. He’ll also more aggressively attack Hillary Clinton, to the extent that’s possible, and he’ll reembrace his role as an outsider, making less of an effort to be nice to GOP graybeards.

During the primaries, when Trump was winning, then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski always said ""let Trump be Trump."" He now wants to get back to that type of campaign culture. The moves send “a signal, perhaps more clearly than ever, that the real-estate magnate intends to finish this race on his own terms, with friends who share his instincts at his side,” Costa writes.

-- This is another proof point that Trump is not trying to run the kind of serious campaign that can actually win the presidency. That’s why it will frighten the GOP establishment, scare off some mainstream donors who have been playing footsie with the billionaire and push congressional leaders like Mitch McConnell a little closer to cutting Trump loose — maybe even before Labor Day. (Bannon’s site single-mindedly went after Paul Ryan in the run-up to his primary.)

-- Both of the newly elevated advisers are conservative populists who will never discourage Trump from following his id. It’s hard for a 70-year-old man to change his ways, especially this one. Donald’s id demands instant gratification more than most people’s, and he’s long struggled to control his impulsiveness.

-- The shake-up also suggests that Trump realizes Manafort’s Ukraine connections have become problematic and undercut the credibility of his attacks on the Clinton Foundation.

The Associated Press reports this morning that “Trump’s campaign chairman helped a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine secretly route at least $2.2 million to two prominent Washington lobbying firms.”

“The project was structured in ways that obscured the foreign party's efforts to influence U.S. policy,” Jeff Horwitz and Desmond Butler report. “The revelation was described to the AP by people directly knowledgeable about the effort. … Under federal law, U.S. lobbyists must tell the Justice Department if they represent foreign leaders or their political parties. A violation is a felony and can result in up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.” (Read the whole story here.)

In Wisconsin last night, Trump announced that he would require “senior officials” in his administration “to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office or from any entity tied to a foreign government.”

-- Another important storyline: Breitbart News has long been Trump’s Pravda, and he just put the guy who runs the site in charge of his campaign staff. Amusingly, Trump’s press release this morning cites a somewhat unflattering 2015 profile from Bloomberg BusinessWeek that calls Bannon “the most dangerous political operative in America.” The release says “he will oversee the campaign staff and operations, in addition to strategic oversight of major campaign initiatives.”

Recall that Breitbart took the side of the Trump campaign after Lewandowski grabbed the arm of one of its reporters (he then lied about it until surveillance footage undercut his story). That reporter, Michelle Fields, subsequently left, and several employees resigned in protest.

-- Roger Ailes, the pugilistic and recently ousted founder of Fox News, is also reportedly moving closer to the inner circle. The New York Times reports that Ailes, still embroiled in a sexual harrassment scandal, is acting as a presidential debate adviser to Trump as he prepares to face off against Clinton. “Two [sources] said Mr. Ailes’s role could extend beyond the debates,” Maggie Haberman and Ashley Parker report. “For Mr. Ailes, being connected with Mr. Trump’s campaign could be a form of redemption after he was pushed out of the powerful network that he helped build.” The Trump campaign, naturally, publicly denies that Ailes has any role on the campaign, per Jose DelReal.

-- Trump is cozying up to Ailes and Bannon after months of being unable to hire A-level talent. The smartest and most ambitious operatives know that having his name on their resume will probably become a scarlet letter that may doom their future prospects. Politico’s Katie Glueck writes that top Republicans in several critical battleground states say, at best, they've never heard of Trump's state directors or have only limited familiarity with them — and at worst, they know them, and question their ability to do the job. Three telling examples from Katie’s piece:

-- Trump offered a revealing window into his management style when he said in 2007 that you should never hire people who are smarter than you. “You have to keep great people around you,” Trump told CNBC. “You always have to be on top of them. And you have to be smarter than they are. I hear so many times, ‘Oh, I want my people to be smarter than I am.’ It’s a lot of crap. You want to be smarter than your people, if possible.”

-- An important reminder of how little time Trump has to right the ship: “Voting actually starts in less than six weeks, on Sept. 23 in Minnesota and South Dakota, the first of some 35 states and the District of Columbia that allow people to cast ballots at polling sites or by mail before Nov. 8,” Patrick Healy writes on the front page of today’s Times. “Iowa is expected to have ballots ready by the end of September, as are Illinois and two other states. The electoral battlegrounds of Arizona and Ohio are to begin voting on Oct. 12, nearly four weeks before Election Day. And North Carolina and Florida will be underway before Halloween. … Nearly 32 percent of voters cast their ballots before Election Day in 2012 … compared with 29.7 percent in 2008 and 20 percent in 2004.”

-- The Trump campaign says it will (finally) begin airing its first television ads since the end of the primaries next week. The first ads will run in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. The buy will then expand to cover other battlegrounds in September, per the Wall Street Journal.

-- Today Trump will receive his first classified intelligence briefing in a SCIF at the FBI’s New York field office. He plans to bring New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Michael Flynn with him. “Career staffers from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence … will be leading the briefing, which is expected to cover major threats and emerging concerns around the world,” ABC News reports.

-- “Like Trump, Flynn has advocated forging closer ties with Russia,” Dana Priest and Greg Miller note in their excellent profile of the retired general. “In interviews with The Washington Post, Flynn acknowledged being paid to give a speech and attend a lavish anniversary party for the Kremlin-controlled RT television network in Moscow last year, where he was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Asked why he would want to be so closely associated with a Kremlin propaganda platform, Flynn said he sees no distinction between RT and other news outlets. ‘What’s CNN? What’s MSNBC? Come on!’ said Flynn.”

“Dismayed by Flynn’s behavior since he left the military, former colleagues have contacted him to urge him to show more restraint. Among them are retired Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who relied heavily on Flynn in Iraq and Afghanistan, and retired Adm. Michael Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,” Dana and Greg report.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

-- Liz Cheney is poised to become a congresswoman after winning the nine-way Republican primary for Wyoming’s open House seat. From the Casper Star Tribune: “Cheney overcame criticism about her ties to Wyoming and won the Republican primary for the U.S. House, a seat once held by her father.” Cheney only got about 40 percent of the vote, but there’s no runoff and it doesn’t matter.

-- Some of the most powerful espionage tools created by the NSA’s most elite group of hackers have mysteriously appeared online, Ellen Nakashima reports, a development that could pose “severe consequences” for the agency’s operations and government security. “The file contained 300 megabytes of information, including several ‘exploits,’ or tools for taking control of firewalls in order to control a network. … The disclosure of the file means that at least one other party — possibly another country’s spy agency — has had access to the same hacking tools used by the NSA and could deploy them against organizations that are using vulnerable routers and firewalls. It might also see what the NSA is targeting and spying on.” Former NSA personnel who worked in the agency’s division said the file appeared to be legitimate. “Without a doubt, they’re the keys to the kingdom,” said one former employee. “The stuff you’re talking about would undermine the security of a lot of major government and corporate networks both here and abroad.”

-- As Vice President Biden arrived in Serbia, hundreds of ultranationalists marched through the streets of Belgrade chanting ""Vote for Trump!"" Biden is there to encourage the country's government to normalize relations with Kosovo, which split from Serbia in 1999 and claimed independence in 2008, Adam Taylor reports.

THE LATEST FROM THE OLYMPICS:

-- The U.S. has settled comfortably into a first-place lead in Rio, with 84 MEDALS total (that’s 28 gold, 28 silver, 28 bronze.) Meanwhile, the race for second is getting tighter: China is now edging out Britain by just ONE SINGLE MEDAL, up 51 to 50. (See the Post’s live medal count here.)

-- The U.S. women’s volleyball team beat Japan in the quarterfinals, advancing after a 25-16, 25-23, 25-22 victory in straight sets. They’ll play Russia/Serbia in the semifinals on Thursday. (Barry Svlruga)

-- Simone Biles claimed her FOURTH gold medal in the women’s gymnastics floor competition, capping off a week of stunning Olympic performances with a score of 15.966. Aly Raisman took home a silver medal and a 15.500 score – her highest marks of the Games. Britain was a distant third. “It’s pretty insane,"" Biles said, eyes widening when asked how she felt about winning four golds and a bronze in her five events. ""What I’ve accomplished in my first Olympics, I’m very proud of myself. I don’t know. It’s crazy."" She also got to meet longtime crush Zac Efron. (Liz Clarke)

-- Jenny Simpson made history after becoming the first American to medal in the women’s 1,500 meter race. ""Elsewhere on the track, Americans Tori Bowie and Deajah Stevens qualified for the women’s 200-meter final, Des Bieler reports. ""Dalilah Muhammad and Ashley Spencer advanced to the women’s 400-meter hurdles final and Kerron Clement did the same for the men’s version.""

-- The U.S. women’s basketball team beat Japan 110-64, advancing to the semifinals.

-- Rio continues to fail as a host city. Tens of thousands of volunteers have stopped showing up to the Games, grumbling they were overworked and underfed – pulling eight and nine hour shifts with only a small snack provided to break up the minutiae. One volunteer cited what he called the organizing committee’s lack of “consideration for people’s lives and welfare.” They “use us for free labor,” he told reporters. (Marissa Payne)

-- The FBI forcefully defended its decision not to criminally charge Clinton for her use of a private email server at the State Department, outlining their rationale in a letter to House Oversight Committee lawmakers. From Matt Zapotosky and Karoun Demirjian: “FBI Director James Comey announced in early July that he was recommending Clinton not be charged, and the letter … largely repeated statements he had made previously in public. But it also notably seemed to take aim at some ongoing conservative criticisms of Clinton – particularly that she was negligent in her handling of classified information and thus deserving of criminal charges.”

Jason Herring, who directs the FBI’s Office of Congressional Affairs, wrote that someone else who engaged in the type of conduct of which Clinton was accused might face “severe administrative consequences,” and the FBI was in the process of providing relevant information to other government agencies. But Herring also asserted that investigators found no evidence Clinton intended to mishandle classified information, noting that even three emails marked as classified did not originate with her and that State had determined two of them did not contain classified information.” (Read the four-page letter here.)

“The FBI’s letter to the Judiciary Committee makes clear this is much ado about nothing,” Senate Intelligence Committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who released the letter, said in a statement last night.

House Oversight Chair Jason Chaffetz said the documents provided by the FBI yesterday left him “unpersuaded,” and “while members of his committee would were ‘not investigating the investigators,’ they were ‘trying to figure out what happened so that we can try to solve it.’ ‘We got to make sure this never ever happens again,’ Chaffetz said.”

-- Overplaying their hand: Trump adviser Al Baldasaro doubled down on his comment that Clinton should be “shot for treason” for using a private email server. ""The liberal media took what I said and went against the law and the Constitution and ran with it, and they said that I wanted her assassinated, which I never did,"" Baldasaro said. ""I said I spoke as a veteran, and she should be shot in a firing squad for treason."" (MassLive.com)

-- For the first time, the Clinton campaign pushed back against conspiracy theories from the fever swamps of the right that her health is frail. The evening press release included a statement from the former secretary of state’s doctor, Lisa Bardack, who maintained that she is in “excellent” health and that documents circulating online under her name are fake. “While it is dismaying to see the Republican nominee for president push deranged conspiracy theories in a foreign policy speech, it’s no longer surprising,” said Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign's communications director. “Trump is simply parroting lies based on fabricated documents promoted by Roger Stone and his right wing allies."" (David Weigel)

-- Hillary won the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a progressive group that worked to defeat her in the primaries. The group said 68 percent of members voted to endorse her. (David Weigel)

-- The campaign says it is “seriously” eyeing Utah as a potentially winnable state this year: On Bloomberg’s “Masters of Politics” podcast, field director Marlon Marshall confirmed the campaign sees opportunity in the state. “Are we going to win Utah? I don't know. But is it something that's on our radar? Yeah, we're gonna take a look,” he said. (Bloomberg)

-- Tim Kaine is fretting about Democratic complacency: He notes that few pundits predicted Trump would win the Republican nomination, and that few elites actually believed the British would vote to exit the European Union. He worries about a last-minute infusion of nasty ads from outside groups. “This is going to be a close race, I predict,” the senator said at a rally in Asheville, N.C. “We’re doing really good in some polls right now. … But you’ve just got to remember, this has been a season of surprises.” Yesterday, Kaine visited Fayetteville, home to the Army’s Fort Bragg. On Monday night, he played his harmonica at a bar. (John Wagner)

-- Clinton still won't say whether she'll stick with Merrick Garland if she wins. “Five months after winning nomination to the Supreme Court and becoming the object of a pitched partisan battle, Garland now finds himself in a surprising position: irrelevance,"" Mike DeBonis reports. ""The name of the mild-mannered appeals court judge … has been almost entirely absent from the campaign trail ... If she wins, Clinton will face pressure from her party’s left wing to select someone younger or more liberal than Garland. Standing by Obama’s man could alienate liberal Democrats, including those who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders. ... Still, others remain convinced she will stand by her support of Garland: 'I would think that she and all the people around her would say, ‘Why do we need to rock the boat here? Let’s get him confirmed quickly and move on to the next one, whenever that comes,' Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid told reporters last week.""

-- Citing the inherent conflicts of interest, the Boston Globe’s editorial board today calls for the Clinton Foundation to stop accepting donations – and shut down entirely if Clinton wins the presidency.

-- Several members of Trump’s newly-unveiled Agriculture Advisory Committee have been strong supporters of giving legal status to undocumented workers, Jose A. DelReal reports. “The 64-person committee will meet regularly, according to the campaign, and advise the GOP presidential nominee on food production issues. But several of those listed seem to be opposed to Trump's calls for mass deportation and strongly supported the comprehensive immigration reform package passed by the Senate in 2013 … Immigrant labor is a bedrock of the agriculture industry in the United States, many members of the newly formed committee have argued, and a shortage in the already scant agriculture labor pool would raise consumer prices.”

-- On Fox News, Trump said his proposed Muslim ban would not be able to stop everyone. ""Will people go through the cracks? Perhaps,"" he said. ""But it can be very, very tough. It's got to be very tough to come into this country.""

-- “Clinton’s and Trump’s approaches to racial politics mirror the fault lines of a nation,” by Abby Phillip and Jose A. DelReal: She campaigned in some of the most predominantly African American sections of Philadelphia yesterday, trying to run up the score with base voters. In the midst of racial turmoil in Milwaukee, Trump made a point to campaign last night in the predominantly white suburb of West Bend. ""Before the event, he met with local law enforcement officers to emphasize his commitment to being the ‘law and order’ candidate. The vastly different approaches to minority outreach by the candidates and their campaigns mirror the fault lines of a divided nation.""

-- New York Times, “Trump Casinos’ Tax Debt Was $30 Million. Then Christie Took Office,” by Russ Buettner: “By the time Chris Christie became governor of New Jersey, the state’s auditors and lawyers had been battling for several years to collect long-overdue taxes owed by [Trump’s casinos] … The total, with interest, had grown to almost $30 million. The state had doggedly pursued the matter through two of the casinos’ bankruptcy cases and even accused the company led by Mr. Trump of filing false reports with state casino regulators about the amount of taxes it had paid. But the year after [Christie] took office, the tone of the litigation shifted. The state entertained settlement offers. And in December 2011 … the state agreed to accept just $5 million, roughly 17 cents on the dollar of what auditors said the casinos owed.""

A coincidence? “Mr. Christie was close to the attorney general at the time, Paula T. Dow, whom he had appointed and who [previously] worked for him .... A week after the settlement was signed, Mr. Christie announced that he was appointing Ms. Dow to the counsel’s office of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey until he could find her the judgeship that she desired. ... The following month, Page Six reported that the Christies and the Trumps were seen double dating.""

-- Another crazy scenario to think about: Faithless Republican electors could become a problem for Trump. From Politico’s Kyle Cheney: Peter Greathouse, a Republican from Utah, says he’s not “comfortable” with Trump as his party’s nominee. Jane Lynch of Arizona says she’ll likely cast her personal vote for Gary Johnson. Texas Republican Loren Byers calls Trump “a loose cannon.” “Their critiques rank as mild in this polarized election year – until you consider who they are. All three are members of the Electoral College, and if Trump wins their states in November, they’ll be asked to cast the formal ballots that could make him president. Interviews with Republican members of the Electoral College – all from the red states Trump has his best chance of winning – reveal that the divisions that have wracked the GOP for months have also reached this oft-overlooked body with the ultimate authority to decide the election. All of the members contacted … insisted they would cast their electoral vote for Trump if he prevailed … But most indicated they would do so through gritted teeth – if only to reject [Clinton] or to uphold oaths they took to their party.”

-- More than 120 Republicans have now signed a letter urging the RNC to divert financial resources from Trump’s campaign, calling on party officials to shift funds to down-ballot Republicans instead. The letter, while first reported last week, was delivered to the RNC yesterday. (Katie Zezima)

-- Lindsey Graham predicted Trump will lose because of his incendiary rhetoric about minorities. “Reality is reality,” the South Carolina senator said in a radio interview. “Mitt Romney got 27% of the Hispanic vote. By 2050, a majority of the country will be African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and others, and we’re losing demographically. We’ve gone from 44% with Bush to 27% with Romney, and I don’t think Trump is going to get 20%.” Graham added that Trump’s candidacy has put the Republican Party on a course for a “demographic meltdown.” (Buzzfeed)

-- Rick Perry came to Trump’s defense in his dispute with the father of a slain Muslim American soldier, saying Khizr Khan “struck the first blow” and is therefore fair game. ""In a campaign, if you’re going to go out and think that you can take a shot at somebody and not have incoming coming back at you, shame on you,"" the former Texas governor said on CNN. His remarks break with current Gov. Greg Abbott, who has issued a statement saying the service of families like the Khans ""cannot be questioned."" (Texas Tribune)

-- Gary Johnson’s campaign said it raised $2.9 million online in the first two weeks of August. They claimed 90,000 donors contributed an average of $32. (Time)

-- “The Trump two-step: How a GOP senator is trying, awkwardly, to keep his job,” by Philip Rucker: “As Sen. Patrick J. Toomey convened a roundtable discussion with local law enforcement leaders here in Western Pennsylvania, he made no boasts about a big, beautiful wall, or rounding up illegal immigrants … Instead, Toomey asked questions and listened. He spoke softly and judiciously. The message he hoped voters in this battleground state would take away was clear: I may be a Republican, but I’m no Trump. ... Once celebrated by his party’s grass-roots activists as a conservative purist, Toomey has labored throughout his first term to soften his image, most prominently by co-authoring gun-control legislation backed by Democrats."" Still, the two men’s fates are intertwined: Trump sees Pennsylvania as a must-win state, and the outcome of Toomey’s race could determine whether Republicans maintain control of the Senate. “Pat Toomey had positioned himself extremely well to win reelection,” said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.). “The challenge for Pat is things outside his control."" (Al Hunt writes his Bloomberg column today on Clinton's big edge in the Philly suburbs.)

-- Another vulnerable senator, New Hampshire's Kelly Ayotte, explained the difference, as she sees it, between voting for someone and ""endorsing"" them. “There’s actually a big distinction: Everyone gets a vote, I do too,” Ayotte told CNN. “And an endorsement is when you are campaigning with someone.” She says she “endorsed” Mitt Romney by campaigning with him but would not appear with Trump. “While he has my vote he doesn’t have my endorsement,” Ayotte said of Trump.

-- “The abortion rights movement is bolder than it’s been in years. That’s Cecile Richards’s plan,” by Caitlin Gibson: “In person, 59-year-old [Cecile] Richards exudes both a warm authenticity and a subtle impenetrability; there’s the sense that she means everything she says, but she isn’t saying everything. Polarizing? The word could have been invented for her. It’s a safe bet that how you view her depends on where you stand on abortion: She’s composed, heroic, a righteous defender of the vulnerable; or she’s cold, unfeeling, a cunning apologist for baby murderers. She gets standing ovations. She also gets death threats. In a lineup of past presidents of Planned Parenthood … Richards stands out: her background isn’t in women’s health care. It’s in organizing and politics. And she has deployed her skills in those fields to win major battles for abortion rights. Planned Parenthood endorsed Clinton in this year’s Democratic primary, taking sides for the first time … [Now], most strikingly, Richards has set her sights on the Maginot Line of the abortion wars — federal funding for abortions.”

-- Yesterday's most touching moment came after U.S. runner Abbey D’Agostino and New Zealander Nikki Hamblin collided during a women’s 5,000-meter heat. Both athletes stopped to help each other up – urging the other to continue in a show of remarkable sportsmanship and camaraderie. “I’m never going to forget that moment,” Hamblin said. “When someone asks me what happened in Rio in 20 years’ time, that’s my story.” And the story has a happy ending – despite being the last two competitors to cross the finish line, both girls will be allowed to compete in the final this Friday.

-- ""For two Olympians, a humiliating journey to Rio filled with gender-questioning,"" by Cindy Boren: ""Caster Semenya of South Africa and India’s Dutee Chand have fought lengthy, tough battles to earn their spots in Rio this week. In addition to the grueling training required of an Olympic athlete, they have been subjected to indignities and the public perusal of intensely intimate information. Both have a condition called hyperandrogenism, characterized by natural levels of testosterone … that are high enough to place them in the male range as far as international track and field officials are concerned.” Semenya, favored to win gold in the women’s 800-meter race today, was subject to a high-profile spate of testing after she was called a man by one of her 2009 competitors. Chand had to endure a legal battle. “All the scientific study detracts from what is an intensely personal journey for women, who want to compete in the bodies in which they were born."" Chand has said she “cried for three straight days” after reading what people said about her online.

-- New York Magazine reporter David Wallace-Wells gives a terrifying, first-person account of the JFK Airport shooting scare: “I can’t remember what happened first — the flashing light of a fire alarm, the yelled warnings of a bomb and a shooter, the people turning around in a mob panic. I thought I saw smoke. I know I saw bags dropped, people falling to the floor and others stomping past them, through them, on them. The word stampede comes from the animal kingdom — gazelles running away from lions, horses running from some other threat. But there is really no other word for what happened last night at JFK, because panic turned us all into animals. Not only did police and security fail to prevent the spectacle of mob hysteria; on some level, given the way they pressed a hysterical crowd right back into a compressed space, they staged it. The way they handled the fallout, though, might have been even worse.”

One scene: “One man I talked to had darted down a jet bridge to take cover, inspiring others to follow, running and yelling. Only when he reached the end did he realize that the door was locked, and that, because there was no plane on the other side of it, he was actually suspended 20 feet or more in the air, like at the end of an unfinished bridge, with dozens or maybe even hundreds coming behind him. He’d have to smash the window, he figured … then just jump. That’s when he heard the screams of the crowd storming toward him: ‘They’re coming this way!’”

-- Vogue got a surprising amount of access to Huma for a profile --> “Huma Abedin On Her Job, Family, and the Campaign of a Lifetime,” by Nathan Heller: “Powerful, glamorous, and ubiquitous, Abedin is in many ways the engine at the center of Clinton’s well-run machine, crucial and yet largely out of sight. To onlookers, Clinton and Abedin seem to travel the world as a single entity joined by complementary strengths. If Clinton spends her life at the microphone, Abedin is constitutionally circumspect. If Clinton, in her bold suits and impeccable coifs, distills a certain era of feminist empowerment, Abedin, with her breezy downtown dresses and mobile power-dialing, is the professional face of a younger, more wired-in female generation. As Clinton’s longest-serving staffer, she is both the campaign’s deepest memory and its farthest-seeing eye—a woman who, more than anyone besides the Clintons themselves, can envisage the sort of president that Hillary will be … To hear Abedin tell it, though, she’s just a kind of accidental Forrest Gump of politics.”

4620,WHOA! SOROS-LINKED GROUP Funding Ohio’s John Kasich Campaign,"Soros is a Hungarian immigrant who s doing his best to turn America into a weak third world failed country. He s behind Obama and behind so many of the bad things that have happened to America in the past 7 years. He s as dirty as it gets so it s no surprise that he s behind the effort to bring down Donald Trump. If you live in Ohio, please make an effort to NOT vote for Kasich tomorrow because it s a vote for far left open border policies. As new reports break that a George Soros-linked group is taking credit for efforts to violently disrupt GOP frontrunner Donald Trump s campaign rallies, the Center for Responsive Politics reveals that another George Soros-linked group is coordinating another furtive operation to stop Trump by financing the campaign of John Kasich.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Soros Fund Management is one of John Kasich s top financial contributors.George Soros a liberal progressive donor  has been a top funder of the push to open America s borders. According to a 2013 CNS News report,  Soros s Open Society Foundation proudly claimed to have given $100 million dollars to  immigrant rights  projects in the United States.  According to the report, those that have been the beneficiaries of that $100 million include La Raza (Soros funding $2.4 million), the Immigrant Legal Resource Center (Soros funding $1.6 million), as well as Amnesty International (Soros funding $844,088) and Immigration Equality (Soros funding: $301,667).In addition, Soros has been financially linked to the National Immigration Forum the group behind the  Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT). As Breitbart reported in 2013, the Evangelical Immigration Table  is actually a front group for players on the institutional left including billionaire George Soros  EIT is running a $250,000 advertising campaign in favor of the Senate s  Gang of Eight  immigration bill. Soros money is frequently tied to groups with innocuous sounding names that promote radical agendas  such as the Evangelical Immigration Table.Interestingly, as Breitbart News has previously reported, John Kasich has made a series of extreme statements on immigration that place him to the furthest leftward reaches of not just the GOP Presidential field, but the Democratic Presidential field as well. For instance, Kasich has said that enforcing our immigration laws and deporting the illegal immigrants is not  humane.  Kasich likened deportations to the Japanese internment camps of World War II. Kasich has also pledged that he will enact amnesty within the first 100 days of his hoped-for Presidency  in effect, meaning that those who support John Kasich s presidential campaign are voting to enact the largest amnesty in U.S. history by April 30, 2017.The Washington Times reported in January of 2015, George Soros was also behind the funding of the Ferguson protests,  Mr. Soros gave at least $33 million in one year to support already-established groups that emboldened the grass-roots, on-the-ground activists in Ferguson, according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit Open Society Foundations. As the 2013 CNS report documents,  Soros has aided hundreds of left-wing groups in America since 2000 under the auspices of his Open Society Foundations. In just 10 years, he gave more than $550 million to liberal organizations in the United States.Read more: Breitbart",1

46188,HEARTBREAKING: Baby Charlie Gard’s Parents End Legal Battle to Come to the US [Video],"This news is heartbreaking because it s the unnecessary delay in treatment that ultimately determined the fate of this little baby:  The window of opportunity has been lost Chris Gard and Connie Yates announced their decision as a high court judge was preparing to oversee the latest round of a five-month legal battle.The parents have said they want to withdraw their application for him to receive experimental treatment in the US because it was  too late  for it to work.In a move that would appear to bring an end to a protracted, emotional legal case in which Great Ormond Street hospital (Gosh) argued his life support should be switched off to prevent him suffering further, their lawyer said on Monday that delays meant  it was no longer in Charlie s interests  to keep him on a ventilator.Mr Justice Francis had been scheduled to analyse what the couple said was fresh evidence at a hearing in the family division of the high court in London.Grant Armstrong, representing Charlie s parents, told the high court in London:  For Charlie, it s too late, time has run out, irreversible muscular damage has been done and the treatment can no longer be a success. He said the parents had made the most painful of decisions, that only parents can make. Armstrong said:  Charlie has waited patiently for treatment. Due to delay, that window of opportunity has been lost. Baby Charlie Gard was born has a rare genetic condition from his parents and is blind, deaf and can only breathe through a ventilator.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON BABY CHARLIE GARD:The horrible result of socialized medicine may be seen in the plight of Charlie Gard. The brain-damaged British baby whose parents recently lost a legal battle to keep him on life support   has now tugged at heart strings as far away as the Oval Office.President Trump tweeted out his willingness to lend a hand   and in doing so exposed the debate over who should make life-and-death decisions for Charlie to a massive audience. If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so,  Trump wrote.The tweet, which noted a similar call for compassion from Pope Francis on Sunday night, comes just ahead of Trump s second international trip later this week, during which he ll meet with world leaders at the G-20 summit it Germany   a conference at which Trump could cross paths with British Prime Minister Theresa May.Trump s tweet also implicitly highlights perceived pitfalls in the British health care system   a publicly funded system   at a time the U.S. is undergoing yet another debate about medical coverage.Gard s parents have fought the courts to keep their son on life support. Chris Gard and Connie Yates want to bring Charlie to the U.S. for experimental therapy. But doctors at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London, who have been caring for Charlie, were granted permission by a court to turn off his life support. Though it was expected Charlie could be removed from the essential devices as soon as Friday, the hospital said in a statement it was putting together unspecified plans to give the 11 month old and his parents  more time together as a family.

7066,New emails under review in Clinton case emerged from Weiner probe,"WASHINGTON — FBI Director James Comey said Friday that investigators had found new emails related to the bureau's previously closed inquiry into Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information, restarting a long-simmering debate over the Democratic nominee's conduct as secretary of State in the closing days of a presidential campaign that Clinton appeared to be putting away.

In a letter to senior lawmakers explaining his decision, Comey said ""the FBI cannot yet assess"" whether the information is ""significant"" nor could he offer a timetable for how long it will take investigators to make an assessment.

But an official familiar with the matter said Friday that the new materials, perhaps thousands of emails, were discovered in the ongoing and separate investigation into sexually charged communications between former New York congressman Anthony Weiner and a 15-year-old girl. Comey was briefed on the findings in recent days, resulting in the director's notification to Congress, said the official who is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

The emails were discovered in a search of a device or devices used by Weiner, who is separated from longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Abedin also had access to the same device or devices.

The official said it was not likely that the FBI's review of the additional emails could be completed by Election Day.

In a brief news conference in Iowa on Friday evening, Clinton said, ""The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately,"" a position earlier outlined in a statement from her campaign chairman, John Podesta. The Democratic nominee called on the FBI ""to release all the information that it has.""

""As you know I've had plenty of words about the FBI lately, but I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong. Justice will prevail,""  Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Thursday night.

During a speech in New Hampshire earlier in the day, the Republican presidential nominee gleefully discussed the ""breaking news announcement.""

""Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,"" Trump said, and her ""criminal scheme"" should not be allowed in the Oval Office.

""Perhaps justice will be done,"" the GOP nominee said of the development.

In his statement, Podesta demanded that the FBI director ""provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter'' to lawmakers.

""Upon completing this investigation more than three months ago, FBI Director Comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call,'' Podesta said. ""In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

""It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election,"" Podesta added.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Friday, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said nothing had ""surfaced to change the president's opinion and views of Secretary Clinton.''

""He's going to be proud to support her from now until Election Day,"" Schultz said.

In July, Comey announced that while Clinton and her aides during her tenure as secretary of State had been ""extremely careless"" in the way they'd handled classified information, he recommended that no criminal charges be filed.

In her press conference Friday, Clinton said she was ""confident"" whatever is included in the new messages under review ""will not change the conclusion reached in July.""

In July, Comey testified before skeptical Republican lawmakers to explain the bureau's recommendation, which had been adopted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

“We’re mystified and confused by the fact pattern you laid out and the conclusion you reached,"" House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told Comey.

Comey, however, was unequivocal in maintaining that the conclusion of investigators was not a close call.

“There is no way anybody would bring a case against John Doe or Hillary Clinton for the second time in 100 years based on those facts,"" he told the House panel on July 7.

Trump has cited the closed FBI probe as evidence that the election was ""rigged"" against him, and at a recent debate the GOP nominee said that, if he's elected president, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton.

""Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame,"" said House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.

""This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators,"" Ryan said in a statement, adding that he was again calling for Clinton to no longer receive classified briefings, a traditional courtesy afforded major-party presidential nominees.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the timing of the decision, so soon before the election, demonstrated ""how serious this discovery must be.""

Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, wrote on Twitter that ""a great day in our campaign just got even better.""

Meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement that ""without knowing how many emails are involved, who wrote them, when they were written or their subject matter, it’s impossible to make any informed judgment on this development.""

She added: ""The FBI has a history of extreme caution near Election Day so as not to influence the results. Today’s break from that tradition is appalling.”

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi accused Republicans of attempting to ""misrepresent'' the FBI's work.

""Sadly but predictably, Republicans are doing their best to ... warp the FBI’s work to serve their partisan conspiracy-mongering against Hillary Clinton,'' Pelosi said.

The uncertainty of what the new FBI review will yield, and when it will be completed, leaves open the question of how much of an impact it will have on the presidential campaign, as Trump looks to mount what would be a historic comeback, as polls show him trailing nationally and in key battleground states.

""Unless the FBI closes this new investigation one way or the other next week, the likely impact will be to cut into Clinton’s margin, with the bigger effect being on down-ballot races than on the outcome of the presidential election,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, in an emailed statement.

Whatever the long-term impact, the short-term jolt to Trump and his supporters, at least, seemed clear.

In his New Hampshire speech, the GOP nominee suggested the rest of his message for the day would no longer matter as much, given the FBI announcement.

""The rest of my speech is going to be so boring,"" he joked.

67618,Ireland demands 'significantly more clarity' from UK over Brexit border,"DUBLIN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ireland needs Britain to provide  significantly more clarity  on its plans for the Irish border, Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Thursday, denting hopes that London was on the verge of a deal to move on to the second phase of Brexit talks. But British Prime Minister Theresa May s room to offer additional concessions to Dublin appeared extremely limited as the Northern Ireland party propping up her government hinted it might withdraw its support if she gives too much.  Avoiding a so-called  hard border  on the island of Ireland is the last major hurdle before Brexit talks can move to negotiations on Britain s future trade relationship with the EU and a possible two-year Brexit transition deal. A mis-step by May could bring down the British government or spook British businesses fearful of a cliff-edge Brexit without a transition deal.  We are looking for significantly more clarity than we currently have from the British negotiating team,  Coveney told parliament in Dublin, adding that  constructive ambiguity  from Britain would not suffice.  Hopefully we will make progress that will allow us to move on to Phase 2 in the middle of December,  he said.  If it is not possible to do that, so be it.  Britain in the coming days needs to demonstrate  sufficient progress  on three key EU conditions   a financial settlement, rights of expatriate citizens and the Irish border   for leaders to give a green light to trade talks at a summit on Dec. 14-15. With significant progress on the financial settlement and citizen rights, a deal on the Irish border would pave the way for Brussels to offer British Prime Minister Theresa May a transition deal as early as January. Britain s Times newspaper, without citing a source, said London was close to a deal after a proposal to devolve more powers to the government of its province of Northern Ireland so that it could ensure regulations there did not diverge from the EU rules in place south of the border across the island. The border between EU-member Ireland and the British region of Northern Ireland will be the UK s only land frontier with the bloc after Brexit, and Dublin fears a hard border could disrupt 20 years of delicate peace in Northern Ireland.  Ireland has called on Britain to provide details of how it will ensure there is no  regulatory divergence  after Brexit in March 2019 that would require physical border infrastructure. But any attempt at a solution will have to convince Northern Ireland s pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 members of parliament are propping up May s government. The party ratcheted up the pressure on Thursday by suggesting it might withdraw its support for May s government.   If there is any hint that in order to placate Dublin and the EU they re prepared to have Northern Ireland treated differently to the rest of the United Kingdom, then they can t rely on our vote,  DUP member of parliament Sammy Wilson said in an interview with the BBC.      European Council President Donald Tusk, who last week set an  absolute deadline  of Monday for May to demonstrate sufficient progress on the three issues, is due to fly to Dublin on Friday for talks with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in a bid to break the deadlock. May will then hold talks in Brussels on Monday with EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker and his chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and will hope to secure a green light to trade talks at a summit on Dec. 14-15. Barnier said on Wednesday the summit would be able to discuss a transition period and that the EU would define a  framework  next year of the  new partnership  with Britain that would follow the transition. May has insisted she wants any new offers to be met with simultaneous assurances from the EU that it will maintain the open trading relationship which businesses are demanding to know soon if they are to maintain investment levels in Britain.

54663,Robin Roberts Says While She Was Dying from Cancer a ‘Familiar Voice’ Came From Her Nurse and Brought Her Back,"Share on Twitter 
For Robin Roberts, losing her mother while she was in the midst of her own fight for her life was an especially hard blow. Roberts's mother had always been there for her through every illness and injury. 
When she needed her mom the most, however, Roberts swears that she could hear her voice, encouraging her not to give up on life. Image Credit: Mireya Acierto/Getty Images 
As PopSugar reports, on a recent episode of “ Harry ,” the “Good Morning America” co-host tearfully recounted the days she spent in the hospital after a bone marrow transplant. Famously open about her battles with breast cancer and a rare bone marrow disease, Roberts tells host Harry Connick Jr. that she had reached the point where the fight was too much for her: 
“There was a time when I sent everybody away, and I was in my room, and I just felt like I'm slipping away. I just couldn't.” 
One of the things that had made Roberts feel like giving up was the fact that her mother was no longer there by her side. However, she was soon to find that her mom was closer than she realized. She tells Harry: 
“I kept hearing this voice, 'Robin! Robin! Robin!' And suddenly, I open my eyes, and it's ... my nurse Jenny. She's looking at me. That was my mother's voice. I am convinced, when I was hearing that, even though it was Jenny, it was my mother's voice I was hearing.” 
Roberts believes that at her point of “ greatest isolation ,” her mother used Jenny to call her back, to remind her to keep fighting. 
Jenny, Roberts says, was “invaluable” during this time. Acknowledging the bond between Roberts and her nurse, Harry surprised Roberts by reuniting her with nurse Jenny and another nurse who had cared for her. An emotional Roberts was able to thank them for not only everything they had done for her, but for what they have done for countless others: 
“Thank you for being our lifeline. Thank you for being there— not only for us, but for our caregivers ... for our loved ones.” ",1
59195," Sitting GOP Senator Has Had ENOUGH, Donates To Alabama Democrat For Senate (IMAGE)","Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake has never been a fan of Donald Trump or his incendiary, divisive brand of politics. Now, he is a leading GOP voice against electing Roy Moore (R-AL) to the United States Senate. Moore is an accused child molester, and has a lifetime history of making all kinds of bigoted and incendiary comments. He has said that homosexuality should be illegal, and that Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. Moore was also removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for refusing to comply with higher court rulings. Well, Flake has finally had enough of his party enabling characters like Moore. He had already said that if he lived in Alabama, he d be voting for Democrat Doug Jones. Now, Flake  has taken his support of Jones even further, in the wake of the Republican National Committee s decision to support an accused child molester rather than a Democrat.Taking to Twitter, Senator Flake posted an image of a check   made out to Doug Jones  Senate campaign.
