49281, This Proof Of Evolution In Humans Will Make Conservative ‘Christians’ Explode With Rage (VIDEO),"Conservatives constantly insist that there is no proof of human evolution, but after watching this video they might tear their own bodies apart just to destroy the evidence contained within.In a video released by Vox, a narrator clearly explains how humans have proof of evolution inside their own bodies that are leftover pieces from our past that we no longer need because we evolved. Your body is a temple, but it s also a museum of natural history,  the narrator says in the introduction. Look closely and you ll see parts that aren t there because you need them, but because your animal ancestors did. No longer serving their previous function, but not costly enough to have disappeared, these remnants of our deep history only make sense within the framework of evolution by natural selection. The video goes on to list several body parts that some people have that are not necessary such as a vestigial muscle in the forearm that can be seen by placing the top of your wrist on a flat surface and touching your pinky with your thumb. Some people have this long tendon band that is commonly found in lemurs and monkeys that need it to grip tree limbs. Approximately 10 percent to 15 percent of people are missing that tendon because we don t  scramble through trees  anymore.Then there are the three muscles attached to our outer ear. These muscle remnants were once a useful nocturnal tool for detecting the direction of sounds and is still found in cats and other mammals. But we have evolved from needing these muscles because we no longer need to survive in the wild forest at night.Goosebumps are yet another leftover vestigial group of muscles, albeit tiny ones, that activate in the effort to increase the amount of space for insulation, which is useless to humans now because we are no longer covered with fur like other mammals.Humans also once had tails, but they are yet another vestigial body part that has disappeared over time because we evolved to no longer need them, so the tail cells die before a full tail develops, which is why we only have tail bones while other mammals develop full tails. As it turns out, human embryos look similar to other vertebrates at 4 weeks in development, complete with a tail. Some humans are still born with a tail that is surgically removed.The video then talks about the palmar grasp reflex, which is found in human babies as well as chimps and other monkeys that allow them to grip whatever is put in their hand. Incredible footage from the past shows a baby holding on tightly to a bar while hanging down, thus demonstrating our  inner monkey. Here s the video via YouTube.This video about human evolution is similar to a video demonstrating the evolution of hippos and whales and how they are related to each other.While that video also made conservative  Christians  blow a gasket, this latest video featuring human evolution ought to make them absolutely explode. So it s perfect to share with any conservative you know. And then just sit back, relax, and watch the fireworks. Featured image via screen capture",1
64576, Carrier Employee Speaks Out On Trump: ‘He Blew Smoke Up Our A**es’,"At a rally last year, Donald Trump said there was a  100 percent chance  he would save the jobs at Carrier, the heating and air-conditioning manufacturer. The deal wasn t a very good one because Indiana taxpayers will shoulder some of the costs of Trump s unfortunate attempt to promote himself. At the same Carrier factory where Trump boasted of having crafted the deal to save jobs, it has begun laying off workers. 338 employees were just laid off. One female employee did an interview with The New Yorker and she didn t hold back.Brenda Darlene Battle, 55, worked at the Carrier Corporation for the past 25 years. Trump came in there to the factory last December and blew smoke up our asses,  Battle told The New Yorker.  He wasn t gonna save those jobs. And, if that s the case, he would have saved us and Rexnord, a company around the corner from us that makes parts. She said that Trump supporters at the factory have gone quiet since the layoffs began. We had a mix of Trump supporters and Clinton supporters at the factory, I d say. The ones that really supported him are quiet right now,  she said.  Some of them got let go yesterday, too. She said that  some of them wore the hats. Not anymore, though,  in reference to the red  Make America Great Again  hats. Personally, I think the President is a  rubber room  politician. He s crazy. He needs a straitjacket. He s in there for his self. He s not in there to help America keep jobs. Because if he was we wouldn t be in the predicament that we re in every day,  she continued.  He keeps howling,  Make America great.  But he can t make America great if all the jobs are leaving the States and going to Mexico. People can t support their families. As for Trump s visit last December to Carrier, she said she thought it was all for show. I think the C.E.O. of Carrier and Trump was in bed together the whole time,  she said.  That day Trump came to Carrier, those two were too chummy. The way they sniggled and giggled. That sneaky kind of sh*t-eating grin. As for Ms. Battle s plans now, she said she s  going to be taking it very easy for a few months and do some of the things that my dad wants to do. She added that her 77-year-old father thinks  Trump blew smoke up our asses, too.The layoffs must really sting for the Trump supporting Carrier employees during  Made in America  week.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.",1
8063,Olympic Ban Adds to Russia’s Culture of Grievances - The New York Times,"ST. PETERSBURG, Russia  —   When a global governing body for sports barred Russia’s track and field team from the 2016 Summer Olympics on Friday over a   doping scandal, it was greeted in Russia, as is so often the case here these days, with a deep sense of victimhood. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called the decision “unjust, of course. ” Russia, Mr. Putin said, is strengthening antidoping controls and athletes should bear personal responsibility for using   drugs. But punishing the whole team, he said, “doesn’t fit any norms of civilized behavior. ” Outside Russia, sporting officials viewed the unanimous decision as a long overdue restoration of some fairness in competitions. After all, in some sporting events Russian athletes had been trouncing competitors for years before it turned out they were using   drugs. But here, the decision only added support for a narrative in Russia’s political culture of grievances that revolves around perceived slights and   conspiracies taking place in the outside world, particularly in Western countries. “Only people who are lazy don’t kick Russia in sports these days,” Dmitry Svishchev, the chairman of the parliamentary committee on sports, culture and youth affairs, told   a sporting news agency, in response to the ban. “Unfortunately, there is such a tendency now. ” The ban is the latest setback in Mr. Putin’s efforts to shed Russia’s pariah status on geopolitical issues like the Ukraine crisis and the war in Syria. When the news broke, Mr. Putin was seeking to win allies among European politicians Friday at an economic forum, where he recited in a speech a long list of grievances against Russia, including the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Russia, he said, expected an “era of benevolence,” but was  . In 2014, the European Union and the United States imposed sanctions on Russia over the conflict in Ukraine. Russia annexed Crimea in March of that year and intervened in the war in the east of Ukraine, the bloodiest in Europe since the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. The sense of   humiliation over the   period has been felt in sports, too, and the Olympic ban prompted some Russians to uncork their anger. The chairman of the Russian Parliament’s foreign affairs committee, Aleksei Pushkov, wrote on Twitter that “the Rio Games ban for our track and field team is an act of political revenge against Russia for its independent foreign policy. ” The decision caps a glum week for Russian sports, during which soccer hooligans rioted in Marseille, France, after Russia and England played to a draw. Videos showed fans streaming through the streets, wielding the weapons of choice of soccer hooligans  —   beer bottles and folding chairs  —   in running melees that left property smashed and dozens injured. “I don’t see anything scary in the fighting of fans,” Igor Lebedev, a member of Parliament who is also on the executive committee of the Russian Football Union, said in a post on Twitter. “On the contrary, good job boys. Stand strong!” Also on Twitter, the spokesman for the Investigative Committee, a powerful law enforcement agency, responded to the assertion of a Marseille prosecutor that the Russians were apparently trained fighters. “A normal man, as a man should be, surprises them,” wrote the spokesman, Vladimir Markin. “They are used to seeing ‘men’ at gay parades. ” Officials also found themselves on the defensive when it emerged that a prominent extreme rightist, Aleksandr Shprygin, who has been photographed raising his hand in a Nazi salute, led a formal Russian fan club, the Union of Supporters, to France. Groups that monitor hate speech regard Mr. Shprygin as someone who has played a leading role in introducing   ideals into Russia’s soccer hooligan culture. The global governing body for track and field, the International Association of Athletics Federations, announced the Olympics ban on Friday, ruling in a unanimous vote that Russia had not done enough to restore global confidence in its athletes’ integrity. Speaking before the announcement, Mr. Putin said the allegations of doping against his country’s athletes were part of a politically motivated “  policy” by the West. There should be “no collective punishment,” of athletes, Mr. Putin said of the allegations that Russia’s athletes engaged in the extensive use of   drugs. Sports doping is a global problem, he said, and Russia has been unfairly singled out. “Sports area cannot be politicized,” Mr. Putin said Friday. “This cannot be a foundation for building   policy. ” Mr. Putin denied   of doping, one of the pivotal accusations against Russia. “There have never been and cannot be any support for violations in sports, in particular, in the field of doping, at the state level in Russia,” he said. “We have cooperated and will cooperate with all international organizations that work in this field. ” After the announcement, Mr. Putin added “I hope that we find some solution here, but that certainly doesn’t mean we will become insulted and say we won’t fight against doping. It’s the other way around, we will strengthen the fight against doping. ” Russia’s sports ministry, which has alternatively stonewalled investigators and conceded that abuses had taken place but said they had been addressed, issued a statement saying it would appeal the decision and expressed disappointment. “The Russian side has done everything to restore trust of the international sports community in our athletes,” it said. A laboratory in Britain now tests the urine of Russian athletes. “Every Russian athlete undergoes three additional tests. ” A Russian champion   Yelena Isinbayeva, 34, said that she would sue the I. A. A. F. for “a breach of human rights” for barring her from the Olympics, and that the ban was particularly painful as the 2016 Games would be the last for her. Russian commentators said the sporting scandal could be seen as a microcosm of Russia’s broader struggles in the world today. “Officials share this view of Russian society, a society on the defensive,” Sergei Markov, a former lawmaker with the ruling United Russia party, said of the soccer riots in Marseille. “Why should we trust the French authorities that these Russian hooligans are more guilty than the British hooligans? No. If we believe we are under attack, then we believe that Russian soccer hooligans are under attack. They had a right to defend themselves. “Partly, they fought for Crimea on the Marseille streets,” Mr. Markov said.",0
13218, Hilarious Video Shows The Moment Bernie Discovered He’s Related To His SNL Impersonator,"The 2016 election cycle was rife with hilarious   and often spot on   impersonations of the most talked about candidates. One such candidate was, of course, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) who was competing for the Democratic Party s presidential nomination. On the iconic sketch show Saturday Night Live, Bernie was prominently portrayed by comedian Larry David. The impression was uncannily accurate   if we didn t know better, Larry David could easily have been mistaken for Bernie Sanders. From looks, to mannerisms, to general speech patterns and demeanor, David s Bernie impression was spot on. Well, there might be a reason for that: It turns out that Bernie Sanders and Larry David are actually related.The best part of all of this is that the two men did not know that they were related until quite recently, and their reactions to the news have been caught on video. They found out via Finding Your Roots, a PBS program that helps people find their ancestry and relatives they perhaps did not know about. It turns out that Sanders and David are cousins.When he found out, David simply said, What the hell. That is really funny. That is amazing Alright, cousin Bernie. Bernie says: You re kidding. That is unbelievable. People say to me, they talk about Larry David, and I say he does a better Bernie Sanders than I do. Well, now we know why Larry David does such a good Bernie impression.At any rate, we could all use a laugh right about now, so enjoy!

11548,RUSSIA HITS OBAMA…HARD: “We are reaching a really terrifying conclusion for the whole world: That the White House is defending Islamic State.,"U.S.-led coalition air strikes killed dozens of Syrian soldiers on Saturday, endangering a U.S.-Russian ceasefire and prompting an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting as tensions between Moscow and Washington escalated.Just a few days ago it was reported that Putin felt that if anything happened to damage the tentative ceasefire agreement that it would be Obama s fault. Seems he was right.Reuters reported:The United States military said the coalition stopped the attacks against what it had believed to be Islamic State positions in northeast Syria after Russia informed it that Syrian military personnel and vehicles may have been hit.  The United States relayed its  regret  through the Russian government for what it described as the unintentional loss of life of Syrian forces in the strike, a senior Obama administration official said in an emailed statement.  Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said in an emailed statement that Russian officials did not voice concerns earlier on Saturday when informed that coalition aircraft would be operating in the strike area.  The 15-member Security Council met on Saturday night after Russia demanded an emergency session to discuss the incident and accused the United States of jeopardizing the Syria deal.  The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, chastised Russia for the move. Russia really needs to stop the cheap point scoring and the grandstanding and the stunts and focus on what matters, which is implementation of something we negotiated in good faith with them,  Power told reporters. She said the United States was investigating the air strikes and  if we determine that we did indeed strike Syrian military personnel, that was not our intention and we of course regret the loss of life.  When asked if the incident spelled the end of the Syria deal between Moscow and Washington, Russia s U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said:  This is a very big question mark.   I would be very interested to see how Washington is going to react. If what Ambassador Power has done today is any indication of their possible reaction then we are in serious trouble,  Churkin told reporters. Moscow cited the strikes, which allowed Islamic State fighters to briefly overrun a Syrian army position near Deir al-Zor airport, as evidence that the United States was helping the jihadist militants.   We are reaching a really terrifying conclusion for the whole world: That the White House is defending Islamic State. Now there can be no doubts about that,  the RIA Novosti news agency quoted Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying.  Power said Zakharova should be embarrassed by that claim. Churkin said Russia had no  specific evidence  of the United States colluding with Islamic State militants. The Syrian conflict has been a tug-o-war between Washington and Moscow for some time now. Both Putin an Obama have pulled maneuvers that could have been detrimental to all involved, but this latest air-strike was such an obvious and epic failure that Obama can t hide from. We have all felt that he supports the Islamic State terror group and if this  accident  doesn t show that then nothing will. Lets hope an pray that the ramifications aren t too harsh.The discussions are still being maintained in a diplomatic way thankfully and they haven t reached a level of action by Russia against the U.S. as of yet.H/T [ Reuters ] ",1
34362,"In breathless U.S. election, Twitter generates buzz not cash","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - This year’s presidential election might be the perfect microcosm of Twitter’s woes.         While some of the most memorable moments of the campaign for the White House have played out on the platform, Twitter has been unable to turn the attention and activity into ad dollars or user growth.      Well suited to quick updates on a noisy and unpredictable campaign, Twitter has been the dominant social media platform in 2016 for candidates, pundits and journalists.  Republican nominee Donald Trump’s frequent tweeting of tirades against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, fellow Republicans and the media have been a mainstay of the campaign, setting off furious online debate.  But Twitter Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto acknowledged when the company reported its quarterly earnings Thursday that the election has had “no noticeable impact” on Twitter’s user growth, which analysts say is essential for boosting revenue.     Campaigns and political organizations told Reuters that Twitter is simply not a great medium for political advertising. It is not as effective as rival Facebook at targeting crucial independent voters, and high-profile Twitter users like Trump and Clinton can use it as a megaphone without buying any advertising.  “We haven’t really used Twitter, largely because our core mission is to reach those undecided voters,” said Alixandria Lapp, executive director of the House Majority PAC, which supports Democratic U.S. House of Representatives candidates.             A flood of hate speech and misinformation, which Twitter has done little to tamp down, can also be a barrier to ad buys, campaign digital strategists said.          Facebook has emerged as the social media ad platform of choice. It reaches about 94 percent of voters who are registered as independent or are not affiliated with a political party; Twitter only reaches 45 percent of these voters, according to data of mobile users by tracking service Comscore Inc.  Vincent Harris, an Austin-based digital strategist who has worked for U.S. Senator Rand Paul and does some work for Trump,     estimated that about 30 percent of his clients’ budgets are spent on Facebook, while only 5 percent are spent on Twitter.  A recent survey conducted by his company Harris Media found that 81.6 percent of voters said they spent time on Facebook in the last month, while only 28.7 percent spent time on Twitter. “MINUTE-TO-MINUTE” As Clinton digital strategist Teddy Goff put it, Twitter is the “place to be for obsessively tracking the minute-to-minute of this election” but “Facebook is a much purer platform for message dissemination and talking about the issues voters care about.” Doug Watts, the national executive director of the pro-Trump Committee for American Sovereignty Super PAC, said: “We use Facebook the most, partially because of the scale, but also when you are talking conservative politics, they have an older audience that fits our target.” Twitter, he said, is “not really for advertising per se.” The Trump campaign has promoted tweets and placed ad content, said Jessica Ditto, a campaign spokeswoman. But she said it is difficult to use Twitter to collect donations and email addresses because promoted content does not typically get a lot of clicks. The perception is a costly one for Twitter. Elections often provide a big financial boost for advertising platforms such as television and radio stations.      In the 2016 contest, CNN has taken in $100 million more than expected due to intense interest in the election, according to David Folkenflik, National Public Radio’s media reporter. But on Twitter’s earnings call on Thursday, CFO Noto said:     “We really need to have a (presidential) debate on Twitter every day for it to meaningfully improve the quarterly metrics.” Some advertisers have tried to take advantage of Twitter’s central role in the election. Earlier this month, Harris used Twitter to promote a digital campaign that was launched by the conservative anti-immigration group Secure America Now.      More common, though, is the way Clinton operatives use Twitter to engage with what Goff described as a “politically attuned audience.”     The Clinton campaign collects automated donations via its Troll Trump tool, which asks supporters to pledge a small amount to the campaign every time Trump sends a tweet. The feature is now bringing in $1,588 per tweet, at an average of $11,823 per day, the campaign said.        After Trump called Clinton a “nasty woman” during a  presidential debate, her female supporters co-opted the term on Twitter, using #NastyWoman to show their support.   Representative Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, tweeted: “From one #NastyWoman to another, you were an inspiration last night.” Women’s health provider Planned Parenthood tweeted this week that “Early voting shows a surge of #NastyWomen at the polls – and we’re just getting started.” ",0
50853, House GOP Puts DISGUSTING Restriction On Who’s Allowed To See Their New Healthcare Plan,"Paul Ryan said that the House would implement a completely transparent process for repealing and replacing Obamacare. Either Ryan has no idea what his fellow Republicans are up to, or he himself lied about this. He specifically told the  Today Show: We re not hatching some bill in a backroom and plopping it on the American people s front door. Really. There s a problem, considering that Rep. Chris Collins, of New York, said to the Washington Examiner: [The plan will] be made available Thursday morning to Republicans in a basement room of an office building that adjoins the Capitol. That s what they consider transparent? Please! What are they afraid of?According to New York Magazine, the GOP s  replacement  will absolutely rip health insurance away from millions of Americans   the same millions who were able to afford insurance under the ACA. That s especially true for low-income Americans, who benefited greatly from the ACA s expansion of Medicaid, and also the tax subsidies that went towards the cost of premiums for people who made too much for Medicaid, but too little to afford insurance any other way.In Trump s empty speech to a joint session of Congress, he reiterated the old GOP talking points of expanded health savings accounts and tax credits. The thing with those tax credits, though, is that they re based entirely on age. A 50-year old wealthy person would get the same tax credit as a 50-year old poor person. That gives the poor a lot less help than they re getting now, while the rich get a tax credit they don t need.But isn t that par for the course for the GOP? Anything to help their rich buddies, and the poor can go fuck themselves, because they really should have thought of all of this before they decided to be poor. Right? Right.Wrong. That would be part of why House Republicans only want this plan to be made available to Republicans. Democrats and everyone else would rightfully blast it for what it is   more help to the rich while leaving the poor in the dust.The rest of the problems likely have to do with insurance coverage and the deficit, but according to Collins, the House Health Subcommittee might vote on their bill before the Congressional Budget Office has a chance to release its score, so it s not yet clear who all (besides the poor) will be hurt. That would probably be another reason Republicans don t want anyone else seeing this.It s disgusting. It s ridiculous. It s manipulative. And it s classic Republicanism. They ve sunk to a low we didn t think they were capable of.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",1

68539, Trump Just Went After China In UNHINGED Rant; America’s Future In FREE FALL (DETAILS),"It wasn t too long ago that Donald Trump deeply offended China by taking a phone call from Taiwan, violating the One China policy. Since then, foreign relations under this new failing presidency have been nothing but chaotic and tense   and unfortunately Trump is just making things worse.Over the weekend, Trump showed everyone that he s learning absolutely nothing about diplomacy, as he sent another  f*ck you  to China. In an interview with the Financial Times published Sunday, Trump warned China that if they don t get North Korea under control, America would step in. Trump said he is  totally  confident that the U.S. could handle North Korea s nuclear weapons program without any help. His words were: If China is not going to solve North Korea, we will. That is all I am telling you. China has great influence over North Korea. And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won t. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don t it won t be good for anyone. Then, he claimed that he could motivate China to move against the North Koreans, yet failed to clarify: I m not going to tell you. You know, I am not the United States of the past where we tell you where we are going to hit in the Middle East. This interview also had several other insane elements to it, in which Trump continued to defend his lies about former President Barack Obama wiretapping him and insisted that those false claims were  turning out to be true.  However, his comments about China are likely some of the most disturbing to come out of the interview.Trump s timing couldn t be more disastrous, as he is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago club this week   which will likely be another opportunity for Trump to disrespect China and put America at risk.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",1

57471, WATCH: Trump Crudely HUMILIATED A Woman Onstage Because She Accidentally Didn’t Introduce Him,"Donald Trump is a petty thin-skinned wannabe dictator who loves revenge. And this is proof.As we all know, the Republican nominee is getting hammered by sexual assault accusations and the fact that he bragged about groping and kissing women against their will.We also know that Trump retaliates over the smallest slights or perceived slights and has no problem insulting women.Well, during a Miss Universe appearance in Australia back in 2011, Trump went on stage and promptly announced to the audience that he intended to get revenge on someone because they didn t introduce him because of a simple miscommunication. Get even with people,  Trump said.  If they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. I really believe that. Then he called out the name of his victim, who also happened to be the 2004 Miss Universe winner from Australia, and demanded she come on stage and stand beside him so he could make an example of her in front of everyone. I ll give you an example: Jennifer Hawkins. Where s Jennifer? Where s she sitting? Get over here, Jennifer. First of all, how beautiful is Jennifer? This is about getting even. I was so angry at her yesterday. Seriously, as I said, I thought that she dissed me. I thought that my Jennifer   I m going around saying she s my favorite Miss Universe, but I think I like the new one better, Jennifer. So I go around saying she s the greatest   then when I came here, there was no Jennifer Hawkins to introduce me. Hawkins tried to defend herself by explaining that there was a miscommunication, but Trump disregarded what she had to say and proceeded to viciously humiliate her in front of her countrymen and women. I was actually going to get up and tell you that Jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside, but she s not very bright. That wouldn t have been true, but I would have said it anyway. Because I said,  You know what, it would be great. I haven t seen Jennifer in a couple of years. She s so great and she did so well, and she s a big star here, and I helped her make it   I own the Miss Universe pageant. And I heard that she wouldn t introduce me. And then to add insult to injury, Trump tried to crack a sex joke and then attempted to kiss Hawkins even though she clearly was not interested in having Trump s lips anywhere near her.Here s the video via Huffington Post.Donald Trump is a creep and a pervert who thinks revenge is the answer to any little insult or slight, real or imagined. He does not have the temperament to be president and the thing we need is a revenge-obsessed egomaniac in control of America s nuclear arsenal and military forces.Featured Image: Kena Betancur/Getty Images",1

He said it was  set up by a bunch of crooks , adding:  It s like these things on the internet where they tell you to read the conditions   no one s going to bloody read the conditions!

Hitting out at the unnecessary layers of Government it has created, he added:  Because there are so many politicians we get so much useless f***ing law. Attacking the way the EU has impacted on people s lives, he said:  That s the biggest issue for me, it s undemocratic, highly dysfunctional, I mean you name me one area of Europe that s functioning really well at the moment. They talk about the immigration thing being the number one issue and I think it is a big issue for our country because we are an island.

55134, Ex-White House Press Secretary Just Dropped An AWESOME Obama Truthbomb That Will Make Trump PISSED,"The differences between President Barack Obama and Donald Trump couldn t be greater and more obvious   and that s why Americans all over the country are mourning the end of Obama s second term, knowing full well that Trump and the GOP are going to destroy his legacy.Earlier today, Jay Carney   a former White House press secretary for Obama   went on CNN s New Day and highlighted a massive difference between Obama and Trump, and it s one that will make Trump seriously pissed off. Host Alisyn Camerota brought up the fact that Obama s personal life has been scandal-free (unlike Trump s) and asked: Beyond having a scandal-free presidency in terms of personal-life scandals, what do you think President Obama s legacy is? Carney gave an answer that will have Republicans attacking Obama even more. Having worked with Obama personally, Carney said: I think that it was scandal-free beyond his personal life. The man s integrity, his decency and optimism about America that he embodied and pursued will be his legacy. Referring to the Obama administration as patriotic and pure,  Carney said: It was an honest and sincere effort driven towards the idea of making America better and improving the lives of everyday Americans. Many of us would agree. You can watch Carney deliver every Republican s worst nightmare below:Obama demonstrated and lived America s values every day of his life, and every day of his presidency. Trump, on the other hand, has had several sexual assault cases filed against him, hasn t paid his taxes in well over a decade, is involved in several lawsuits over his scammy, fraudulent business dealings, and has more conflicts of interest incidents happening in his administration than is even Constitutional. Trump is shaping up to be America s most corrupt president, and even his supporters are losing faith in his campaign promises.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",1

By Mark Fiore Award-winning animator Mark Fiore wonders if the Republican candidate can ""sue his way to the White House"" in his latest animation. Watch the clip and read the animator's thoughts on Trump below. When Donald Trump warns of a rigged election depriving him of the White House, his call to arms will most likely be a call to his lawyers. Judging by his track record, surely there has never been a more sue-happy nominee for president . If voters don’t cooperate by Making America Great Again, maybe The Donald can sue his way to the White House. The American Bar Association sponsored a report that looked into Trump being a “libel bully,” that is, suing people willy-nilly to shut them up. The report on Trump was so ominous, the ABA refused to publish it. Fortunately, you can find it here . If Donald Trump will sue anyone from bartenders to journalists to Miss Pennsylvania, surely he is not above suing voters who have the temerity to vote for Hillary Clinton. Of course lawyers helped get George W. Bush into the Oval Office, but Trump-law is a different story . Enjoy the cartoon and be sure to see what’s going on over on my Patreon page .
