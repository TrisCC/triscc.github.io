1704,The attacks on George Stephanopoulos are getting the problem backward,"On the one hand, I find it weird that George Stephanopoulos donated $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation. He should have known how it would look.

On the other hand, look is really the operative word there. It's not as if Stephanopoulos's ties to the Clintons were some kind of closely guarded secret:

Stephanopoulos worked on Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign for president. He was communications director in Clinton's White House. The sudden realization that Stephanopoulos might be, in his heart of hearts, sympathetic toward the Clintons is a bit odd.

It's easier to see what's going on here when you realize Stephanopoulos wasn't the only media figure to donate to the Clinton Foundation. Dylan Byers reports that the hyper-conservative Newsmax gave more than a million dollars. So did James Murdoch — yes, he's one of those Murdochs — and the News Corporation Foundation, the Murdoch family's philanthropy, threw in at least another $500,000.

But no one much cares about those donations because no one really thinks Newsmax or Fox News are going to end up biased toward the Clintons. They care about Stephanopoulos's donation because they think Stephanopoulos is already biased toward the Clintons, and this just proves it.

But the attacks on Stephanopoulos are getting the possible scandal almost exactly backward. Stephanopoulos, Murdoch, Newsmax, and all the other Clinton donors weren't donating to the Clinton Foundation because they're biased toward the Clintons; they were donating to the Clinton Foundation because they want the Clintons to be biased toward them.

After all, if you're a powerful media figure trying to help out the Clintons on the sly, the last thing you want to do is publicly donate $75,000 to them so everyone thinks you're in their pocket. But if you're a powerful media figure — or a giant corporation — who wants to keep good relations with the Clintons, maybe you do want to make that donation. Bill Clinton, after all, was watching those donations carefully, and he was grateful to the people and institutions that stepped up to support a project he cared about.

It's hard to remember now, but Clinton managed, for a moment, to depoliticize his foundation pretty effectively. At the time Stephanopoulos made his contribution, supporting Clinton's charity was almost as bipartisan as supporting Simpson-Bowles. This was a moment when Mitt Romney and Donald Trump were also supporting the Clinton Foundation, after all. But that speaks to the deeper corruption of the Clinton Foundation, which became, to all appearances, a way for pretty much anyone to buy some goodwill with the Clintons.

Look at the other names on Byers's list of media or media-related companies that donated to the Clinton Foundation: Carlos Slim, Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg L.P., Time Warner, AOL, HBO, Twitter, Google. These titans and institutions weren't donating to Clinton Foundation just because they liked the Clintons — they were donating to the Clinton Foundation because they wanted the Clintons to like them.

Which is all to say that while it was a mistake for Stephanopoulos to donate to the Clinton Foundation, it didn't change much: he's either biased toward the Clintons in a way that affects his coverage, or he isn't, and that would have been true with or without his contribution. The more worrying question is whether the Clintons are biased toward the people and companies who give millions of dollars to their foundation.",0
47917,"Illegal Immigration Fell 67 Percent under Trump, Says Fmr. Border Chief","During Congressional testimony Tuesday, a former federal border commissioner claimed that illegal immigration across the Mexican border is progressively dropping each month since the inauguration of Donald Trump. [David V. Aguilar, former U. S. Border Patrol and acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner, told the Senate Homeland Security Committee that March 2017 figures he reviewed indicate illegal border crossings are down 67 percent, according to The Washington Times. By comparison, February statistics indicating the number of illegal alien apprehensions fell 40 percent.  “It’s actually up to 67 percent drop compared to last year,” Aguilar told the Senate committee. The former Border Patrol chief explained that similar decreases occurred during the Reagan Administration but later spiked in the decades to follow. Mr. Aguilar’s Capitol Hill comments were not immediately verified by U. S. Customs and Border Protection. The retired law enforcer’s statement does, however, follow news previously reported by Breitbart Texas related to the mothballing of temporary holding facilities for the   surge of migrants throughout 2016. In   a Rio Grande Valley Sector facility near the   Bravo International Bridge was closed after the prior month’s Family Unit Aliens (FMUA) and Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) border apprehensions exhibited   tumbles. Days later, Breitbart Texas reported on a second overflow facility closure located about 40 miles east of El Paso. Both plants were placed in “warm standby” status capable of reversal in less than 24 hours. March 2017 figures have not yet been released by CBP.

7038, Meet The Cowardly Republicans Who Re-Endorsed Trump After Condemning Him For Sexual Assault,"Republicans everywhere have been denouncing Trump for his boasts about sexually assaulting women, but it seems that they can t stick to their guns. In a very cowardly move, four Republicans have re-endorsed him, one has knuckled under and stayed quiet, and more are sure to follow both of these leads. These weak-kneed, spineless rat turds are busy putting party over country, and it s disgusting.First up: Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska. She made her position clear on the radio shortly after the worst weekend Trump has ever had. As a woman, there is no way she should still support him, and yet, she does for some sick reason: Well, like most Nebraskans, I am fully committed to defeating Hillary Clinton. I support the Republican ticket and I plan to vote for Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence on November 8th. She went on to say that she d never said she wouldn t vote for the GOP ticket, which is likely true, but smacks of making excuses. All she s done is show that beating Hillary is more important than the very real danger of legitimizing sexual crimes, and making a predator into a role model for our children. Giving in to that ideology is the move of a coward.Senator John Thune of South Dakota is next. He tweeted that Trump should withdraw and Mike Pence should take over. Now, though? He s caved like the chickenshit he is, too. He said: He has a lot of work to do, I think, to win this election. But I m certainly not going to vote for Hillary Clinton. So vote for Evan McMullin   at least he s respectable, knowledgeable and sane, unlike Trump and his minions.New Jersey Congressman Scott Garrett said that he felt Mike Pence was a better candidate than Trump following Trump s unmasking as a sexual predator. However, Garrett s campaign has since said that he still feels Trump is the best candidate to lead our country. His spokesman said, in part: Donald Trump remains the nominee of the Republican Party, and Rep. Garrett has always said he will vote for the Republican Party nominee. Scott Garrett s top priority in this election is stopping the Clinton-Gottheimer agenda of higher taxes, more wasteful spending, and weak national security policy. All important issues, but dismissing half the electorate by essentially saying,  Sure, we care about you, but your problems with sexual assault are just not that important,  right now is clueless and vile. It s typical sexism, actually.In fourth place, but tied for first, is Congressman Bradley Byrne of Alabama. We probably shouldn t be surprised that an official from Alabama would decide to support Trump, though, even after sixteen straight months of rotting vomit spewing forth from his mouth. Byrne was one of the first officials in Alabama to call on Trump to step down, but apparently, that s all changed now that it s been a week since Trump s  hot mic  tape was released.Byrne s spokesman, Seth Burrow, said: He will support the Republican ticket on Election Day, as he has pledged to do all along. He just believes that person should be Mike Pence. He just believes that person should be Mike Pence,  is one of the worst cop-outs in the long, sad history of bad cop-outs.And last, but certainly not least, is Paul Ryan. While he has refused to campaign with Trump anymore, and even disinvited him to an event in Wisconsin, he s got an extraordinarily flimsy position on Trump now. He won t talk about Trump, and he seems to be urging people to just kind of forget about Trump s Twitter storms and other problems.No mention of Trump being a sexual predator, which is unbelievably hypocritical for someone as  Christian  as Paul Ryan. To be sure, Ryan never rescinded his endorsement of Trump, and apparently, that position has not changed. It s still sick.More Republicans are sure to follow as they decide their party is more important than actually standing for what s right. They are bloody pieces of feces-infused wimpiness for that, considering they keep trumpeting every type of  moral value  there is.Photo of Deb Fischer by Mark Wilson, photo of John Thune by Alex Wong, photo of Scott Garrett by Chip Somodevilla, Photo of Paul Ryan by Win McNamee, via Getty Images.

71640,"China gets an early win off Trump, but many battles remain","BEIJING (Reuters) - Combining public bluster with behind-the-scenes diplomacy, China wrested a concession from the United States as the two presidents spoke for the first time this week, but Beijing may not be able to derive much comfort from the win on U.S. policy toward Taiwan. Several areas of disagreement between the superpowers, including currency, trade, the South China Sea and North Korea, were not mentioned in public statements on Thursday’s telephone conversation between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. In getting Trump to change course on the “one China” policy, Beijing may have overplayed its hand. Trump had upset Beijing before he took office by taking a call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, then casting doubt on the “one China” policy, under which Washington acknowledges the Chinese position that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it. Trump changed tack and agreed to honor the “one China” policy during the call, prompting jubilation in China. Beijing  had been working on diplomatic ways to engage Trump’s team and largely blaming Taiwan for stirring things up. [nL4N1FV21K] Laying the foundation for that call had been the low-key engagement of China’s former ambassador to Washington and top diplomat, the urbane and fluent English-speaking Yang Jiechi, with Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn. “China was pragmatic and patient. It made every effort to smooth out the relationship, and it paid off,” said Jia Qingguo, dean of the School of International Studies at Peking University, who has advised the government on foreign policy. But China also made very clear Taiwan was not up for negotiation, unleashing state media to threaten war and punishment for U.S. firms if that bottom line was breached. China has long described self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its sacred territory, as the most sensitive issue in Sino-U.S. relations.  Its military had become alarmed after the Trump-Tsai call and was considering strong measures to prevent the island from moving toward independence, sources with ties to senior military officers told Reuters in December. [nL4N1ES0VR] A source familiar with China’s thinking on relations with the United States, speaking to Reuters last month, said China had actually not been too bothered with Trump’s Taiwan comments before he took office as he was not president then and was only expressing his personal view. “If he continues with this once he becomes president then there’s no saying what we’ll do,” the source said. Despite the U.S. concession, military tensions remain. On Saturday, the overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily placed a picture on its front page of Chinese warships about to embark on a new round of drills in the South China Sea, right next to an upbeat commentary about the Xi-Trump call. The paper’s WeChat account took a harsher line, saying that with Trump getting back with the program on “one China”, Taiwan had better watch out. “The heart of that Madame Tsai on the other side of the Taiwan Strait must at this moment be chilled to the core,” it said. One senior Western diplomat said China had been redoubling its efforts to win over the Vatican, one of a handful of countries to retain official ties with Taiwan. Taiwan says it hopes for continued U.S. support, and one ruling Democratic Progressive Party official told Reuters that the “one China” policy had not affected previous U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, even as U.S. presidents’ commitment to the island have waxed and waned. Xi has put great personal political capital into seeking a solution over Taiwan, an issue that has festered since 1949 when defeated Nationalist forces fled to the island after losing the civil war to the Communists. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. But in its relations with Washington, the risk for Beijing remains that its diplomatic win over “one China” will be short lived, as Trump will not want to be seen as having caved in. “What he’s shown the Chinese is he’s willing to touch the ‘third rail’ of U.S.-China relations,” said Dean Cheng, China expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. “Beijing can’t predict what he’ll do next – and he’s only been in office three weeks. What is he going to do on trade and other economic issues?” U.S. officials said the affirmation of the “one China” policy was an effort to get the relationship back on track and moving forward. [nL1N1FV1RU] But Trump’s change of tack may be seen by Beijing as a climbdown, said Tom Rafferty, the China Regional Manager for the Economist Intelligence Unit. “Mr Trump is erratic and will not appreciate the suggestion that he has been weak.” ",0
57733,"Immigration Ban Is Unlikely to Reduce Terrorist Threat, Experts Say - The New York Times","Rarely does an executive order announce a more straightforward and laudable purpose than the one President Trump signed on Friday: “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States. ” But the president’s directive is unlikely to significantly reduce the terrorist threat in the United States, which has been a minuscule part of the overall toll of violence since 2001. Many experts believe the order’s unintended consequences will make the threat worse. While the order requires the Department of Homeland Security to issue a report within 180 days providing detailed statistics on foreign nationals who commit acts of violence, terrorism researchers have already produced rich and revealing data. For instance, since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, no one has been killed in the United States in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from or whose parents emigrated from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, the seven countries targeted in the order’s   visa ban, according to Charles Kurzman, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina. Of Muslim Americans involved in violent extremism of any kind  —   for instance, charged with plotting terrorism or supporting a terrorist group  —   only 23 percent had family backgrounds in those countries, said Mr. Kurzman, who just published the latest of his annual studies of Muslim Americans and terrorism. The larger point of experts is that jihadist attacks garner news attention that far outstrips their prevalence in the United States, and the president’s order appears to address not a rational calculation of risks but the visceral fears that terrorists set out to inflame. There was a random quality to the list of countries: It excluded Saudi Arabia and Egypt, where the founders of Al Qaeda and many other jihadist groups have originated. Also excluded are Pakistan and Afghanistan, where persistent extremism and decades of war have produced militants who have occasionally reached the United States. Notably, perhaps, the list avoided Muslim countries where Mr. Trump has major business ventures. Nor did the list include the European countries where disenfranchised Muslim communities have become hotbeds of militancy, leading to major attacks in Paris and Brussels in the name of the Islamic State. Because no visas are required for travel by most European citizens to the United States, and because of the volume of tourism and business, restricting travel from Europe would have been far more difficult and consequential than banning it from only the seven countries named. By Mr. Kurzman’s count, 123 people have been killed in the United States by Muslim terrorists since the 2001 attacks  —   out of a total of more than 230, 000 killings, by gang members, drug dealers, angry spouses, white supremacists, psychopaths, drunks and people of every description. So the order addresses, at most, 870th of the problem of lethal violence in America. If the toll of Sept. 11 is included, jihadists still account for just over 1 percent of killings. “My advice to the new administration would be to declare victory,” Mr. Kurzman said. For the average American, he added, “your odds of being victimized by a terrorist attack are infinitesimal. ” But terrorists  —   the root of the word means “to cause to tremble”  —   do not operate in the realm of dry facts and statistics. Their purpose is to terrify, and they use random and spectacular violence to do it, with an invaluable assist from the saturation coverage on cable television and news websites that such outrages inevitably draw. To the rational calculations of Mr. Kurzman, one might simply reply with the list of American cities where horrific jihadist attacks have occurred in recent years: Boston San Bernardino, Calif. and Orlando, Fla.  —   place names that conjure up images of ghastly wounds,   bodies and frightened people running for cover. In Gallup polls, the number of Americans “very worried” or “somewhat worried” about such attacks generally hovers between 30 and 50 percent, with understandable spikes after new attacks. In the political realm, where emotions and symbols hold sway, Mr. Trump’s order may reassure some Americans that they are safer from terrorism, and more generally, from concerns that Muslim immigrants may bring an alien culture. (While ostensibly addressing terrorism, it also says that the United States should be protected against those with “hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles” or those “who do not support the Constitution. ”) The trouble with such reassurance, even if it is effective, is that it comes at a high cost, in the view of many experts on terrorism. That cost will be counted not just domestically but also abroad, where the United States relies on allies, including Muslim countries, for intelligence and other help against terrorism. “In my opinion, this is just a huge mistake in terms of counterterrorism cooperation,” said Daniel Benjamin, formerly the State Department’s top counterterrorism official and now a scholar at Dartmouth. “For the life of me, I don’t see why we would want to alienate the Iraqis when they are the ground force against ISIS. ” At home as well, Mr. Benjamin said, the president’s order is likely to prove counterproductive. The jihadist threat in the United States has turned out to be largely homegrown, he said, and the order will encourage precisely the resentments and anxieties on the part of Muslims that fuel, in rare cases, support for the ideology of the Islamic State or Al Qaeda. “It sends an unmistakable message to the American Muslim community that they are facing discrimination and isolation,” Mr. Benjamin said. That, he said, will “feed the jihadist narrative” that the United States is at war with Islam, potentially encouraging a few more Muslims to plot violence. For an action aimed at terrorism, the order appeared to garner little or no support among experts and former officials of every political stripe with experience in the field. Jonathan Schanzer, the vice president for research at the conservative Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said that if the temporary visa ban was used to review and improve immigration vetting procedures, it might be justified. But he added that he knew of no obvious problems with those procedures, and no specific plans to address such issues during the temporary restrictions on visitors and refugees. “The order appears to be based mainly on a campaign promise,” he said. Mr. Schanzer said he was frustrated that during the Obama administration, there had been inadequate attention to the ultimate driver of refugee flows and jihadist terrorism in the United States and elsewhere. “We have several bloody, complex and interlocking conflicts in the Middle East,” he said. “It’s the job of the new administration to come up with policies that address those conflicts. Admittedly, that is not easy. ” Much easier, clearly, is issuing an executive order with political appeal and a title that seems to smack of common sense. But as the Trump administration is finding out, such pronouncements from an American president have many consequences, not all of them intended, anticipated or desired.",0
49469,U.S. envoy to Russia: visa consultations in consulates may resume soon - TASS,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Visa consultations in U.S. consulates in Russia could be resumed in the near future, TASS news agency cited U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman as saying on Monday.

34439, Alec Baldwin Just Tore Trump Apart Limb By Stupid Limb After Hellish Weekend Of Tyranny (TWEETS),"After this past week and few days that Trump has been our President*, we as Americans have no choice but to be fully aware of the horrors that are in store for us. Already, he has signed executive orders authorizing a partial Muslim ban that led to nationwide protests before it was ultimately shut down (temporarily) by a federal judge, removing funding from any international health organizations that so much as mention abortion, two major pipelines that will destroy our environment, his stupid fucking wall, and even concentration camps for the millions of undocumented immigrants he intends to round up.Already, the first President in history that was effectively installed by a hostile foreign dictator through an aggressive propaganda and fake news campaign as well as a series of hacks directly authorized and overseen by Russian President Vladimir Putin, is not only proving the naysayers correct, but showing the world that they have underestimated the level of horribleness he can attain. As always, Alec Baldwin rushed to the rescue Saturday night with exactly the words we need to hear:1- This country had a calling card.We all knew what it was.It wasn't Wall Street or Hollywood or the right to bear arms that brought  ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 29, 20172- that brought countless people, America's future, to this country.

It wasn t Wall Street or Hollywood or the right to bear arms that brought America s future, to this country. It was freedom,  Baldwin wrote.  Freedom was our calling card. Trump wants to kill that. Baldwin came to the conclusion reached by many, including a growing number of those who voted for him:  Trump s gota go. 3- Trump's gotta go.  ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 29, 2017 All the indignation is fine. But we gotta get him out! We must demand a competency test!  Baldwin later added.  He is ill! Mentally ill! All the indignation is fine.But we gotta get him out!We must demand a competency test!He is ill!Mentally ill!  ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 29, 2017He s exactly right. Unfortunately most options are going to prove to be fruitless. Impeachment would require the rather enthusiastic participation of a Republican-controlled Congress. The 25th Amendment allows the Vice President and cabinet to declare him unfit for pretty much any reason, but that requires the people Trump appointed to turn on him and things are actually going pretty well for them right now as The Donald checks off the Neo-Nazi wish list items one by one. It would also require Republicans in general to be halfway decent people who care about the good of their country.Right now, things seem hopeless but something amazing is happening. Trump is bringing Americans together, causing even those who once were silent in the face of right-wing oppression to rise up and declare that they are not willing to take it anymore. Americans as a whole are facing this adversity head-on and, most importantly, together.Right now, our future is uncertain, but our number one duty to our country is to oppose Trump s hateful agenda at every turn. Our elected leaders   the ones with backbones, anyway   absolutely must obstruct Trump in any way possible. Our nation has never faced a test like Donald Trump, and it is imperative that we do not fail.Featured image via screengrab",1

38710,German admits selling gun to Munich attack shooter,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A 32-year-old German man admitted in court on Monday that he sold the weapon used by a teenage gunman who killed nine people in Munich last year, a court spokesman said, adding that the defendant told relatives he felt sorry for his actions. David Ali Sonboly, 18, killed nine people before shooting himself dead. Another 27 people were injured. Police concluded the German-born Sonboly was a deranged lone gunman obsessed with mass killings who drew no inspiration from Islamist militancy. The Munich public prosecutor s office has charged the accused, identified only as Philipp K., as is customary in German law, with selling weapons illegally and nine counts of negligent homicide as well as five counts of negligently causing grievous bodily harm.  A written statement was read, acknowledging that the accused had traded with weapons. The defendant expressed his regret that one of these firearms was used in the rampage here in Munich,  court spokesman Florian Gliwitzky said.  He offered his apologies to the relatives and with this, he also expressed that he was regretting his actions.  A spokeswoman for the public prosecutor said the suspect so far only had admitted to the charge of selling weapons illegally. She added that evidence revealed during the hearing showed that the suspect had far-right attitudes. A defense lawyer said his client would not give any more statements in the course of the trial. Authorities arrested the man in Marburg, about 100 km (65 miles) north of Frankfurt a year ago, after contacting him on the so-called  dark net  and posing as buyers for an automatic weapon and a Glock 17 pistol for 8,000 euros ($9,550). During a sting operation, the suspected arms dealer said he had sold the 18-year-old Iranian-German another Glock 17 pistol during a meeting in Marburg, followed by 350 rounds of ammunition during a second meeting. Authorities around Europe are concerned that secretive marketplaces make it too easy for criminals and militants to obtain weaponry that has traditionally been highly regulated across Europe. ",0
40557,U.S. lawmakers want retaliation for sonic attacks in Cuba,"WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - Five Republican senators called on Friday for Washington to retaliate for an alleged sonic attack, inaudible to some human ears, on U.S. personnel in Cuba by expelling Cuban diplomats and possibly closing the U.S. embassy in Havana. In August, the State Department said Americans linked to the U.S. embassy in the capital had experienced physical symptoms caused by such “incidents,” involving sound waves, starting as far back as late 2016. Five Canadians in Havana were also affected.  In some cases the victims heard nothing, while others sensed deafening sound, but all suffered symptoms such as nausea, dizziness and temporary hearing or memory loss. The incidents have left a sense of unease among Havana’s diplomatic community, various diplomats said, and the Cuban Foreign Ministry has not provided any explanation to date. A months-long investigation by Cuba, the United States and Canada into the mysterious affair, unprecedented in modern diplomatic history, has yet to come up with answers as to how the attacks took place, let alone who was behind them. Cuba has denied involvement. The U.S. State Department has not blamed Havana for the attacks, but asked two Cuban diplomats to leave Washington in May. Canada does not intend to take diplomatic action “at this time,” an official said in August. In a letter, the five Republicans - Senators Tom Cotton, Richard Burr, John Cornyn, Marco Rubio and James Lankford - urged Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to remind the Cuban government of its responsibility toward diplomats. “Furthermore, we ask that you immediately declare all accredited Cuban diplomats in the United States persona non grata and, if Cuba does not take tangible action, close the U.S. Embassy in Havana,” they wrote. All five are members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the congressional panels looking into the matter. Burr is its chairman and Cornyn is the number two Republican in the Senate. President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans control majorities in both houses of the U.S. Congress. The letter came as the United States was expected to issue new, tighter restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba, as part of a partial rollback of the U.S.-Cuban detente by President Donald Trump. Rubio, a Cuban-American, was a key player in forging the new, more hostile policy toward the island. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. The seaside U.S. embassy in Havana was still closed due to damage in the wake of Hurricane Irma, with staff working from the ambassador’s residence and from home. A source close to the investigation underway on the island said the Cubans had been very cooperative, even offering to let the FBI in to investigate for example. “As far as we have ever known, the U.S. officials here in Cuba have never suspected the Cubans as perpetrating these events,” the source said. Foreign policy experts say it is hard to see what Cuba would have to gain from perpetrating attacks on diplomats. It has enjoyed good relations with Canada for many years and in 2014 started to normalize relations with its old Cold War enemy the United States. Theories abound. One is that another country like Russia, Iran or North Korea might want to drive a wedge between Cuba and the west. Another is that there is an internal power struggle underway on the island. ",0
5554,Support for Hungary's ruling Fidesz highest in six years in October: pollster,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Voter support for Hungary s ruling right-wing Fidesz party rose to its highest since January 2011 at 40 percent according to an opinion poll published on Thursday, less than six months before parliamentary elections due in April 2018. Prime Minister Viktor Orban s Fidesz party looks like the runaway favorite to win a third straight term, campaigning with a fierce anti-immigrant message, coupled with increased spending on wage rises and promising more money to pensioners. Pollster Median said Fidesz  support rose to 40 percent in October from 36 percent in September, while the main radical nationalist opposition party Jobbik lost some of its support. Jobbik s support dropped to 11 percent from 12 percent, while the Socialists scored 7 percent in October, the same as in September. Among decided voters, Fidesz, which won a two-thirds majority in parliament in 2014, was even stronger: its support rose to 61 percent in October from 55 in September, while Jobbik dropped to 14 percent from 16. Endre Hann, managing director of pollster Median, said Fidesz voters showed an unusual determination and willingness to vote according to their survey conducted between Oct. 20 and 24.  And also there is kind of a self-fulfilling process: more and more people feel that the opposition does not have any chance (in next year s election),  he said, adding that the opposition remained fragmented. The Socialist Party s candidate to be prime minister after the 2018 parliamentary election resigned last month, further weakening the leftist party. There is an array of other smaller leftist parties all vying for enough votes to get into parliament. Another pollster, Tarki, said Fidesz  support rose to 39 percent in October from 35 percent in July in the whole population, while Jobbik s support dropped to 10 percent from 11 percent.  The strengthening of the ruling parties is due to some of the uncertain voters choosing them, rather than luring away supporters of opposition parties,  Tarki said. According to Median, about 30 percent of voters have no party preference. Tarki put the undecided camp at 34 percent. ",0
69374,Jodie Foster Is Still Afraid of Failure - The New York Times,"CULVER CITY, Calif.  —   Because of the political moment in which it’s landing, the new movie “Money Monster”  —   about a cheesy TV financial guru and the viewer who takes him hostage  —   will almost surely be seen as a parable of income inequality and a rigged economy. Which, in large part, it is. But to its director, Jodie Foster, it covers terrain more intimate than that, and more personal. It’s a meditation on failure: how keenly people fear it, what they do when confronted with it. Its two main characters, captor and captive, inhabit the same purgatory. They’re coming to terms with their own inadequacy. “Failure is a big one for me  —   people in spiritual crisis, in a moment in life of total ” Ms. Foster told me recently, explaining how the movie, to be released May 13, connects to her. Does she often think of herself as a failure? “Oh yeah,” she said. “Oh my God, yeah. If Mother Teresa is propelled to do good works because she believes in God, I am propelled to do good works because of how bad I feel about myself. It’s the first place I go. ‘Oh, what did I do wrong? ’” This is not the direction in which you expect a conversation with a   Oscar winner to turn. But as guarded as so many decades in the spotlight have made Ms. Foster, there’s also something naked about her, a   too fervent to stay hidden. You see it in her best performances. You saw it at the Golden Globes in 2013, when she accepted an honorary award with a raw, rambling speech that set the Internet ablaze: Had she just come out of the closet? Had she even been in the closet? She was asking at once to be understood and to be left alone, still searching all these years later for a resolution to the contradiction of celebrity, and her remarks were so messy in their way that I was stunned when she told me that she’d scripted them carefully in advance. “Every word,” she said, adding that she even had them put on a teleprompter. “I didn’t want to get it wrong. ” But what precisely was she trying to get right? The world was fixated on her allusions to her private life. She was focused on an announcement about her professional one: On the far side of 50, she was pivoting toward less glamorous work behind the scenes. She hasn’t taken a new acting assignment since, instead concentrating on directing. “Money Monster” is her fourth   effort along those lines, after “Little Man Tate” (1991) “Home for the Holidays” (1995) and “The Beaver” (2011) and it’s by far the most ambitious, a New York City thriller with SWAT teams, explosives, George Clooney and Julia Roberts. Mr. Clooney is the financial guru, who loosely evokes Jim Cramer, the host of the CNBC cable show “Mad Money. ” Ms. Roberts is his producer, who’s in his ear throughout the hostage crisis, talking him through it, as steady as he is spastic. (The captor is played by Jack O’Connell.) One striking aspect of the movie is how large Ms. Roberts’s character looms, and I asked Ms. Foster if that would have been the case in a male director’s hands. She said that she hadn’t thought about that, but, in fact, many of the screenplay revisions that she requested involved fleshing out that role. Strong women are her trademark as a performer, the thread running through “The Accused” (her first Oscar for best actress) “The Silence of the Lambs” (her second) “Panic Room,” “Flightplan,” “The Brave One” and more. But not just strong women: women who don’t turn to a man in the clutch women whose strength is inseparable from the walls they’ve built around themselves. They’re “solitary characters who don’t have mothers and fathers and boyfriends,” she told me, and they demonstrate her desire, when acting, “to have an experience that’s all mine, and I don’t really want to share it. ” “Yet I’m totally desperate to communicate it to you,” she said. “It’s a really weird dichotomy. And I think that’s me in life. ” She sat on a couch, legs curled under her and shoes kicked off, in an office here on the lot of Sony Pictures, which is distributing “Money Monster. ” I’d last seen her in downtown Manhattan months earlier, when she was shooting a crucial scene and when she described, within minutes of our meeting, how powerfully the Clooney part spoke to her. “He’s just a guy on TV, but he’s imbued with this sense of power,” she said, adding that he’s forced to ask questions that she has asked herself: “Am I real? Am I a sellout? Is all of this real?” She meant the adulation that comes with fame, which she achieved early. The year she turned 14, she had five movies released, including “Freaky Friday,” “Bugsy Malone” and “Taxi Driver,” in which her precocious turn as an underage prostitute earned her an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress. During her time at Yale University, she acted in another five movies, juggling them with her studies, including a thesis on   literature. Henry Louis Gates Jr. then teaching there, was one of her advisers. She babysat for his two young children, and he recalled arranging an interview for her with Toni Morrison and telling the novelist only that his student Alicia Foster  —   that’s Jodie’s real name  —   was en route. “When she walked in, I think Toni almost had a heart attack,” Professor Gates, now at Harvard, told me. He and Ms. Foster remain friends, and he said that he still marvels at the poise that “allowed her to get through a crisis that probably would have been crushing to most of us. ” He was referring to John Hinckley Jr. ’s shooting of President Reagan, which Mr. Hinckley, who had stalked Ms. Foster, said he did to impress her. She was in her freshman year at Yale. Not long after she graduated, she considered ditching movies altogether and doing graduate work with Professor Gates. “The Accused” was about to be released, and she was convinced that the movie and her performance were no good. Her mother, Evelyn, worried that “The Silence of the Lambs” would be a mistake and, as Ms. Foster remembers it, said to her: “The good part is Hannibal Lecter. Why are you taking the dull part?” The two have always been extraordinarily close  —   her mother was a single mom and carefully steered her career early on  —   so it pained the actress when they had a much bigger tussle over “Nell,” in which Ms. Foster played a wild woman (literally) who spoke a gibberish of her own invention. Evelyn Foster channeled her broader apprehensions about the movie into her daughter’s specific decision to darken her hair for the role. “She was relentless, and she wouldn’t get off it,” Ms. Foster said. “She was yelling at me. Why did I have to dye my hair? She was just like, ‘You’re ruining your image,’ or whatever it was. And I remember sending her this really long letter, and the letter was, ‘I really love you, but I’m not going to talk to you for four and a half months,’” until the movie wraps. “She totally got it  —   she sent me flowers,” Ms. Foster added. “And then I talked to her four months later. That was one of the movies where if I thought for one minute that I was making a fool of myself, I would not be able to perform. ” She made clear to me that she was sharing that story only because it couldn’t embarrass her mother, who has advanced dementia. Ms. Foster is mindful of the privacy of family members, including her two sons, the oldest of whom will leave for college in the fall, and her wife, the photographer Alexandra Hedison. The couple began their relationship soon after that Golden Globes speech and were wed in early 2014. Ms. Foster deflected questions about that. “I never will talk about marriage and friends,” she said. “There are only so many steps I can take to protect people I love. There’s only so much I can do to keep them safe. It’s kind of a horrible feeling to know that if somebody’s close to you, you put them in danger of being hurt, of being sullied  —   trivialized  —   just by virtue of knowing you. ” In the Globes speech, she fleetingly acknowledged a previous relationship to Cydney Bernard, describing her as “my heroic   my   in love but righteous soul sister in life. ” Did she intend that as the kind of declaration about her sexual orientation that some   advocates had long pressed for? “Everything I have to say on that subject, I said that night,” she told me, acknowledging that some people remained puzzled. “I can be vague. Vague is moving to me. ” In recent years, she has directed episodes of “Orange Is the New Black” and “House of Cards,” picking up Emmy and Directors Guild of America nominations. But her chance to helm movies came earlier, even though that opportunity still eludes many women. She was spared such resistance because so many male executives “knew me as the    who showed up on time, and they didn’t see it as a risk,” she said. “They looked at me as if I was a daughter. They’d seen me grow up. They knew my professionalism. ” So did the “Money Monster” producers. “Talk to anyone who has worked with her,” said one of them, Lara Alameddine. “They’ll tell you the same thing. She is the most prepared person. She’s the first one there and the last one to leave. ” Mel Gibson, who starred in “The Beaver,” said that “the way she directs films, the way she does anything  —   it’s just very smart. She attacks it and deals with it and delivers. ” The two formed a deep friendship after making “Maverick” more than two decades ago, though their bond baffles outsiders. “It’s not my job to adjudicate his behavior,” she said. “He’s certainly not sexist and certainly not racist. I know the guy I know, somebody who’s really emotional, who I can have long, long conversations with, who’s trustworthy, who shows up for me. ” Mr. Gibson said: “I just love her, that’s all. You meet people like that sometimes. You just instantly fall in love, and that’s it, and it’s the purest kind of thing. We call each other up all the time and just say, ‘Hey, I love you. ’” Ms. Foster’s current emphasis on directing over acting partly recognizes that at 53, she won’t find as many great roles as she once did. But it also reflects her ceaseless process of   and  . “Everybody in my life said to me: When you stop acting, you’re going to be lost,” she said, meaning that directors don’t quite have the visibility and currency of actual movie stars. “What are you going to do when people don’t take your phone call or when you can’t get a reservation in a restaurant?” I looked for some sign that she was being falsely modest or pulling my leg. Amazingly, she wasn’t. “Maybe I’ll lose my identity,” she said. “But I guess I need to find out, and I’m willing to take that chance. ”",0
24975,Trump defends tweets as key to White House victory,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump defended his regular use of social media, especially Twitter, and said he may not have won the White House without it. In an interview airing on Sunday on “Fox Business Network,” Trump says he can bypass what he labels unfair media coverage by speaking directly. “Tweeting is like a typewriter — when I put it out, you put it immediately on your show,” he said, according to a transcript released by the network. “I doubt I would be here if weren’t for social media, to be honest with you.” Trump called his social media accounts on Facebook Inc (FB.O), Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Instagram “a tremendous platform.” “When somebody, says something about me, I am able to go bing, bing, bing and I take care of it. The other way, I would never be get the word out,” he said, according to the transcript. Republican leaders have regularly urged Trump to avoid or cut back on tweets and Trump acknowledged some friends suggest he not use social media. Trump regularly mounts attacks on Twitter, especially at news media and political opponents, often sending out missives in the early morning or late evening hours. At times, Trump’s tweets have contained factual inaccuracies and personal attacks. In March for example, Trump asserted without evidence President Barack Obama had ordered Trump Tower in New York wiretapped - something Obama denied. In September, the FBI and the Justice Department said in a court filing “they have no records related to wiretaps as described” by tweets from Trump. He recently excoriated NFL players for taking a knee during the National Anthem. He also criticized Senator Bob Corker in a series of tweets prompting Corker to respond: “It’s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.” White House chief of staff John Kelly said last week some have criticized him for failing to control Trump’s tweeting. “I was not brought to this job to control anything but the flow of information to our president,” Kelly said. In July, Trump was sued in federal court by seven individuals whom he has blocked on Twitter. The Justice Department said the suit should be dismissed, arguing it “rests on the unsupported and erroneous premise that the president’s Twitter account is a public forum for First Amendment purposes.” ",0
43055,The US knows LGBTQ immigrants are often raped in detention. It puts them there anyway.,"American immigration officials frequently choose to detain LGBTQ immigrants — even when their own evaluation system recommends release, putting them at significant risk for sexual abuse, new documents provided by the Center for American Progress show.

Of 104 immigrants who told an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that they were afraid of being put in detention because of their sexual orientation or gender identity between October 2013 and October 2014, 81 were placed in detention anyway, according to records obtained from ICE via a Freedom of Information Act request.

These detentions appear to violate ICE's policies for how unauthorized immigrants living in the US are treated after they're apprehended by immigration agents.

The government doesn't have to detain every immigrant who's apprehended, even if it's seeking to deport him or her. Instead, it can release an immigrant under virtual supervision (like an ankle bracelet) or simply under the supervision of a lawyer, and tell him or her to show up in court for a deportation hearing. (Because many LGBTQ immigrants might qualify for asylum in the US, since they'd be persecuted due to sexual orientation in their home countries, it's particularly likely that they'd show up to court to make their asylum case.)

According to ICE, immigrants who'd be vulnerable in detention because of their sexual orientation or gender identity are recommended for release unless the law requires it — and officers aren't supposed to overrule that recommendation unless they have a very good reason.

""I feel very confident that when someone is processed, when we have the information about their vulnerabilities and we can put that into the system, we're making good decisions,"" one ICE official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Vox.

ICE claims it's done a lot to improve the treatment of LGBTQ immigrants since President Obama took office in 2009. But given the risk of sexual abuse in detention, advocates are saying, it makes no sense for ICE to be putting LGBTQ immigrants in detention at all except in extreme cases.

The fight over LGBTQ detention is just another round in a battle between the Obama administration and immigration activists that stretches back to 2009. Advocates complain the administration isn't doing enough to protect unauthorized immigrants, especially vulnerable immigrants like children, families, and LGBTQ individuals. The administration keeps putting out policies telling ICE agents to use their judgment and protect vulnerable immigrants, but advocates say that agents don't follow through.

But there's also a difference of principle between the administration and advocates. For the administration, the goal is making detention safer for LGBTQ immigrants. Advocates are asking: why are they being detained at all?

Prison rape is a tremendous problem, and it's an especially tremendous problem for LGBTQ inmates. The most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics survey of sexual assault in prisons and jails in the US found that 11.9 percent of LGBTQ men and 9.4 percent of LGBTQ women had been sexually abused by another inmate, and 6 percent of LGBTQ men and 3 percent of LGBTQ women had been assaulted by a guard. (For comparison, only 1 percent of straight men and 3.6 percent of straight women said they'd been sexually victimized by another inmate; only 2 percent of straight men and 1.4 percent of straight women were abused by a guard.)

It's harder to get data on sexual assault in immigration detention, but indications are that it's no less of a problem there. A Fusion analysis of a 2013 government report about sexual abuse in immigration detention found that even though transgender immigrants made up only one of every 500 detainees, they accounted for one of every five cases of sexual assault the Government Accountability Office was able to confirm. (In a majority of cases, the government wasn't able to determine whether an assault had happened.)

Journalists and advocates have repeatedly uncovered stories of LGBTQ immigrants who suffered repeated abuse in detention — particularly transgender women, who are placed in detention with men. In January, advocates started a campaign to demand the release of Nicoll Hernandez-Polanco, a Guatemalan transgender woman who was put into detention after she came to the US to seek asylum. Hernandez-Polanco reported that she'd been routinely groped by guards and referred to as ""it,"" and that she was put in solitary confinement for ""insolence"" when she tried to stand up for herself. (She was released from detention in early May.)

The Obama administration has put effort into developing new policies to improve detention conditions, and they put special emphasis on their efforts to improve treatment of LGBTQ immigrants. They emphasize that they have a ""zero tolerance"" policy for sexual abuse in detention facilities, and that an immigrant should not be put in solitary confinement just because of gender identity or sexual orientation. And they take great pains to point to a detention center in California that has a special unit for gay, bisexual, and transgender inmates.

To decide whether to detain an individual immigrant, ICE goes through an evaluation called the Risk Classification Assessment (RCA). The evaluation collects a lot of details about the immigrant's case, weighs them according to a computer formula, and then generates an automated recommendation about what ICE should do with her.

The automated recommendation isn't binding — ICE officials can decide to override it. But the agency stresses that it's a useful tool to help individual officers adhere to the department's priorities and properly implement prosecutorial discretion. (In some cases, federal law requires that an immigrant be detained — in those cases, ICE still runs the risk evaluation but uses it to figure out how the immigrant should be detained.)

One of the instructions to ICE officers administering the evaluation: ""Ask the individual if he/she fears any harm in detention based on his/her sexual orientation or gender identity.""

Both ICE and advocates stress that a lot of LGBTQ immigrants probably don't want to out themselves after they've been taken into custody. The evaluation ""is only as good as the data we get,"" one ICE official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Vox. So it's almost certain that far more than 104 LGBTQ immigrants came into ICE custody between October 2013 and October 2014. But only 104 were willing to acknowledge it or understood the question being asked.

Here's what happens when an immigrant acknowledges that he or she is afraid of detention because of gender identity or sexual orientation, according to the ICE official: if US law doesn't require them to be detained, ""the RCA will recommend that the officer process them for release."" That release could come with conditions, or could involve other monitoring like an ankle bracelet — but it's definitely not a recommendation for detention. If federal law does require that an LGBTQ immigrant get placed in detention, ICE says, it will use the evaluation to make sure she's put in a facility that will protect her from sexual abuse.

The problem is that isn't what the data shows at all. According to the records obtained by the Center for American Progress, in 81 of the 104 cases where an immigrant said he or she feared being put in detention because of sexual orientation or gender identity, ICE detained him or her anyway.

In almost two-thirds (64 percent) of the 104 cases, it appears the automated assessment didn't even make a recommendation. The records obtained by CAP show the result of the assessment as ""Officer to Determine"" — which, according to a DHS Inspector General report about detention, means it's entirely left up to ICE officials to decide.

ICE maintains that its evaluation always produces a recommendation, and it's just a question of whether the officer follows the recommendation or not. When I asked the ICE official about cases in which the risk evaluation makes no recommendation, the official replied, ""The RCA always produces a result. It always produces one, either to detain or not to detain.""

But the data shows ICE officials had a lot more leeway to make decisions than that. And most of the time, they didn't use that discretion on behalf of the immigrant. In two-thirds of the cases where the automated evaluation made no recommendation — in circumstances where, again, ICE says it should automatically recommend release — agents chose to put the immigrant in detention. (That's about the same rate as the general immigrant population, according to the Inspector General.)

Despite what the ICE official told Vox, in only six of the 104 cases did the risk evaluation recommend that an LGBTQ immigrant get released. But in four of those cases, according to the FOIA data, ICE overruled that recommendation and detained the immigrant anyway.

ICE maintains that the way it treats immigrants with ""special vulnerabilities,"" such as LGBTQ immigrants, hasn't changed since it put the automated evaluation in place in 2012. It doesn't appear to have been following those policies from October 2013 to October 2014. But that doesn't necessarily mean the agency isn't started following them now.

ICE says the formula it uses to make an automatic recommendation is an ""evolving tool."" What officers are supposed to do hasn't changed; instead, they've changed the automated system so that it's more in line with the instructions that ICE agents have.

In particular, ICE says, it made some big changes to the risk evaluation at the beginning of 2014, so that ICE stopped focusing so much on detaining people who might run away and focused more on detaining people who were dangers to public safety. As a result, when it comes to all detainees — not just LGBTQ immigrants — ICE officials went from overruling the evaluation's recommendations about 20 percent of the time in 2013 to less than 8 percent of the time in 2014.

There's no way of knowing how many of the 104 LGBTQ immigrants came in in the last few months of 2013, before the evaluation was changed. And there's no way of knowing whether immigrants who are taken into ICE custody now are getting released more often. But ICE won't say that the older data is unrepresentative, and isn't releasing new data to show there's been a change.

And it maintains that the basic way the evaluation works — always recommending that someone get detained or released, and recommending that LGBTQ immigrants get released whenever the law allows it — hasn't changed since the system was put in place.

So in order to trust that ICE is getting it right now, advocates would have to assume the agency knows it was screwing up before and just won't admit it.",0

These boys would have left their homes and their parents would have thought they were safe and that they were going to a better life, fleeing violence and they end up at 14 being raped in a refugee camp. That it is going on in Europe makes it even more unacceptable.

53043,Donald Trump Starts Summer Push With Crippling Money Deficit - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump enters the general election campaign laboring under the worst financial and organizational disadvantage of any major party nominee in recent history, placing both his candidacy and his party in political peril. Mr. Trump began June with just $1. 3 million in cash on hand, a figure more typical for a campaign for the House of Representatives than the White House. He trailed Hillary Clinton, who raised more than $28 million in May, by more than $41 million, according to reports filed late Monday night with the Federal Election Commission. He has a staff of around 70 people  —   compared with nearly 700 for Mrs. Clinton  —   suggesting only the barest effort toward preparing to contest swing states this fall. And he fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, on Monday, after concerns among allies and donors about his ability to run a competitive race. The Trump campaign has not aired a television advertisement since he effectively secured the nomination in May and has not booked any advertising for the summer or fall. Mrs. Clinton and her allies spent nearly $26 million on advertising in June alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, pummeling Mr. Trump over his temperament, his statements and his mocking of a disabled reporter. The only sustained reply, aside from Mr. Trump’s gibes at rallies and on Twitter, has come from a pair of groups that spent less than $2 million combined. Mr. Trump’s   for May reflects his lag in assembling the core of a national finance team. In the same month that he clinched the Republican nomination, Mr. Trump raised just $3. 1 million and was forced to lend himself $2 million to meet costs. Some invitations to Trump   events have featured the same short list of national Republican finance volunteers regardless of what city the event is held in, suggesting Mr. Trump has had some trouble lining up local  . A spokesman for Mr. Trump did not respond to an inquiry about the campaign’s spending plans. During an interview on Monday on CNN, Mr. Lewandowski defended the candidate’s   approach. “We are leaner, meaner, more efficient, more effective. Get bigger crowds. Get better coverage,” Mr. Lewandowski said. “If this was the business world, people would be commending Mr. Trump for the way he’s run this campaign. ” But the shortfall is leaving Mr. Trump extraordinarily dependent on the Republican National Committee, which has seen record   this campaign cycle and, long before Mr. Trump even declared his upstart candidacy, had begun investing heavily in a   plan to bolster the party’s technical and organizational capacity. In a first for a major party nominee, Mr. Trump has suggested he will leave the crucial task of field organizing in swing states to the Republican National Committee, which typically relies on the party’s nominee to help fund, direct and staff national Republican political efforts. His decision threatens to leave the party with significant shortfalls of money and manpower: On Monday, the party reported raising $13 million during May, about a third of the money it raised in May 2012, when Mitt Romney led the ticket. “It’s like a waterfall,” said Brian O. Walsh, a Republican campaign strategist. “There are things that have to happen, and someone has to pay for them. ” Mr. Trump’s cash crunch marks a stark reversal from the 2012 presidential campaign, which seemed to inaugurate a new era of virtually unlimited money in American politics, buoyed by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision two years earlier. By the same point that year, President Obama and Mr. Romney were raising tens of millions of dollars per month with their parties. And while Mr. Romney faced a larger deficit overall against Mr. Obama in June 2012, he was raising far more money than Mr. Trump is now, with big donors flocking to his cause. “The campaign has got to be the entity that’s out there driving the   car,” said Austin Barbour, a lobbyist who served as national finance   of the Romney campaign. “And it better be a big old Cadillac. ” Mr. Trump has defied conventional wisdom before, clinching the Republican nomination with a small organization and modest outlays on television. And Republican officials believe they are well prepared to compensate for Mr. Trump’s late start. The Republican National Committee has more than 500 field staff members on the ground in swing states, far more than in 2012, and a robust digital and data operation. Allies of Mr. Trump say they believe the tide is already turning. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump will appear at a     in New York City hosted by some of the most prominent names on Wall Street.   for Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said they were now hoping to raise up to $500 million in joint efforts with the Republican National Committee, or an average of $100 million a month from June through October. He is now reliably raising between $5 million and $7 million in each city where he raises money, those donors said. A joint   effort with Mr. Trump and 11 state Republican parties yielded the Republican National Committee $3 million in just five days at the end of May. Some of the largest checks came from a handful of wealthy Trump supporters who are not party mainstays, suggesting Mr. Trump could tap new sources of campaign money. But Mr. Romney was also backed by expansive network of   “super PACs” and other outside groups that collectively spent hundreds of millions of dollars in an effort to elect him. This year, the Democrats are leading in outside money. Priorities USA Action, a group focused on advertising in support of Mrs. Clinton, announced on Monday that it had raised $12 million in May and had $52 million on hand  —   a huge reserve. The outside spending effort to help Mr. Trump, by contrast, has been chaotic and underfunded, hampered by a profusion of competing groups, one of which has spent only $1 million so far on Mr. Trump’s behalf. The most prominent group, Great America, is advised by Ed Rollins, who managed Ronald Reagan’s 1984 campaign, and other more seasoned Republican operatives. But it, too, has had difficulty persuading big donors: On Monday, it reported raising just $1. 4 million during the month of May.   efforts for Mr. Trump have been hampered by the candidate’s own erratic public comments. He has repeatedly said he will pay for his own campaign even as his volunteers fan out around the country to solicit   checks, confusing allies and potential donors alike. “Two days ago, he said, ‘I may fund it myself,’” Mr. Rollins said. “Donors are all being cautious about what’s going to happen here. ”",0
