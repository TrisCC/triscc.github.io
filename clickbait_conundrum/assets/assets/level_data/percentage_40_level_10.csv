10327, Trump Now Desperately Buying Facebook Ads To Beg Americans He Called ‘Stupid’ To Come To Inauguration,"What if you threw a party and most of the people who would otherwise attend avoided it like a particularly virulent strain of syphilis had gone airborn in a ten-mile radius surrounding the National Mall? At this point, the festivities surrounding the inauguration of the United States  next Grand Wizard, Donald Trump, are shaping up to be a complete disaster that will be referenced in every non-Texas history book for generations to come.A minority of Americans and a broken system with a special helping hand from Vladimir Putin and James Comey may have barely  elected  Donald Trump President, but he remains the least popular person to step into the Oval Office since Osama bin Hitler took office in 1897 in an alternate timeline (that s right, we had to reach outside reality to find something to which we could compare Trump s  yuge  level of unpopularity).Trump may be bragging about the  record-setting turnout  he is expecting, but the truth is that he is crying on the inside. Officials are expecting 800,000 to 900,000 people to show up to see Trump being sworn in as our next President. On their own these numbers may seem impressive, but Obama s inauguration attracted double that   a whopping 1.8 million people showed up for him and as we all know, Trump desperately needs to feel like he has beaten Barack Obama at everything.Trump is so desperate that he has taken the rather interesting approach: shamelessly spending money to beg Americans to show up and adore him   well, people over the age of 27 who live in New York, anyway. F*ck the rest of you.imagine being so disliked that 4 days before your inauguration you start paying to send desperate FB ad invites to ""person, 27+"" pic.twitter.com/UQ0m4D7vg4  mah ree nah (@marinarachael) January 17, 2017? ? #Trump Is So Pathetic DesperateTo Fill His #Inauguration Seats He's Put An Ad On His #Facebook Page Inviting People @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/L9jChYlxdU  Marsha (@Whippenz) January 17, 2017Trump is paying $$$ to place a Facebook ad asking (begging) people (ages 27 + up) to attend his Swearing In Ceremony.Pathetic & So Sad . pic.twitter.com/MogbRNrmLj  J Reed (@EarthlingJR) January 17, 2017.@Facebook keeps serving me a video ad where Trump invites me to #Inauguration   but @TrumpInaugural website doesn't work.

Ticket scalpers are losing money on tickets to the event, which promises to be exactly as exciting as the average county fair (with matching entertainment). Trump has managed to snag obsolete one hit wonder pop band Three Doors Down and country artist who is known for showing up to concerts so drunk that he forgets the lyrics to his own songs. Other performances include a 16-year-old reality show contestant, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, a marching band from  Louisiana s most racist high school,  and whichever of the Rockettes decides to show up to this abortion of an event. Basically, if  I just got my Klan robes back from the drycleaner  is not a part of your vernacular, you re gonna have a bad time at this thing.Recently, Trump hate-tweeted the majority of Americans who are not OK with Russia hacking his political opponents on his behalf, calling them  stupid people  and  fools.

35602,Indonesian envoy to urge Myanmar to halt violence against Rohingya Muslims,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo has sent his foreign minister to Myanmar to urge its government to halt violence against Rohingya Muslims, he said on Sunday after a petrol bomb was thrown at the Myanmar embassy in Jakarta. The embassy attack, which police said caused a small fire, came in the early hours of Sunday morning against the backdrop of mounting anger in Indonesia, home to the world s biggest Muslim population, over violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. A police officer patrolling a street behind the embassy spotted a fire on the second floor of the building at about 0235 Jakarta time (GMT+7) and alerted police officers guarding the front gate, a Jakarta police statement said. After the fire was extinguished, police found a shattered beer bottle with a wick attached to it, the statement said, adding that the unknown perpetrator is suspected to have driven away from the scene in an MPV car. Jakarta police are investigating the incident, said spokesman Argo Yuwono. A group of activists had held a protest at the embassy on Saturday, calling for the Nobel Prize Committee to withdraw the Nobel Peace Prize from Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, state news agency Antara wrote. (bit.ly/2eRowl0) Protests continued on Sunday in Jakarta s city center, with dozens of people calling for the Indonesian government to take an active involvement in efforts to end human rights violations  against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. Indonesian President Widodo said he has sent Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi to Myanmar to hold  intensive communications  with involved parties including the United Nations.  Earlier this afternoon the Foreign Minister has departed to Myanmar to ask the Myanmar government to stop and prevent violence, to provide protection to all citizens, including Muslims in Myanmar, and to give access to humanitarian aid,  Widodo said.     Widodo added that concrete actions are needed and the Indonesian government is committed to helping to solve the humanitarian crisis and that Marsudi will also travel to Bangladesh to prepare additional aid for refugees there. The treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing leader Aung San Suu Kyi, accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the minority that has long complained of persecution.  Aid agencies estimate that about 73,000 Rohingya have fled into neighboring Bangladesh since violence in Myanmar erupted last week. ",0

8169,JUST IN: OBAMA REGIME Demanded Homeland Security Officials Stop Using “Sharia” and “Jihadist” Language…Look Who Just Changed That Language [VIDEO],"President Trump addressed the America people today, as he outlined a new and bold national security strategy. The American people are generous. You are determined, you are brave, you are strong, and you are wise. When the American people speak, all of us should listen. And just over one year ago, you spoke loud and you spoke clear. And On November 8th, 2016, you voted to Make America Great Again. You embraced new leadership, and very new strategies, and also a glorious new hope, that is why we are here today. But to seize the opportunities of the future, we must first understand the failures of the past. America  will pursue threats to their source, so that jihadist terrorists are stopped before they ever reach our borders. Legal Insurrection reports- The White House has unveiled President Donald Trump s national security strategy. It has four main points: Protect America, promote our prosperity, preserve peace through strength, and advance our influence.But one of the biggest points is the return of using  jihadist  and  Sharia,  language President Barack Obama s administration tried to avoid.From Fox News: The primary transnational threats Americans face are from jihadist terrorists and transnational criminal organizations,  the document states, according to excerpts released ahead of the speech.A search of the document shows the word jihadist appears 24 times in the 68 page document. Obama s 2015 national security strategy mentioned Islam twice.The document mentions that America  will pursue threats to their source, so that jihadist terrorists are stopped before they ever reach our borders. Trump listed the ways to do this: disrupt terror plots, take direct actions, eliminate terrorist safe havens, sever sources of strength, share responsibility, and combat radicalization & recruitment in communities.David Reaboi at Security Studies Group noted another massive change:Here is my favorite part of the National Security Strategy and it s MASSIVE Admin acknowledges Sharia is goal and driving force behind Islamist terror groups. Obama effectively banned use of any of this terminology. pic.twitter.com/2HVHhnVqjX  David Reaboi (@davereaboi) December 18, 2017He is correct. Back in January 2016, Homeland Security released a report that called for officials to stop using jihad and sharia. The Washington Free Beacon reported at the time:Under the section on terminology, the report calls for rejecting use of an  us versus them  mentality by shunning Islamic language in  Countering Violent Extremism  programs, or CVE, the Obama administration s euphemism that seeks to avoid references to Islam.Under a section on recommended actions on terminology, the report says DHS should  reject religiously-charged terminology and problematic positioning by using plain meaning American English. Government agencies should employ  American English instead of religious, legal and cultural terms like  jihad,   sharia,   takfir  or  umma,  states the June 2016 report by the Council s countering violent extremism subcommittee. The DHS report stated that to avoid a confrontational  us versus them  stance in public efforts to counter Islamic radicalization, government programs should use the term  American Muslim  instead of  Muslim American. The Obama administration insisted on this even though ISIS made it NO secret that they wanted the world to live under Sharia law. The terrorist group even formed an all female brigade to help enforce Sharia law through brutal and violent means. ",1

31381,Miracle Diet: UFC Champ Daniel Cormier Loses 1.2 Pounds in 2.5 Minutes - Breitbart,"Daniel Cormier nearly died from a weight cut nine years ago. On Friday, people nearly died laughing after a Daniel Cormier weight cut. [The UFC light heavyweight champion tipped the scales at 206. 2 for his Saturday night title defense against Anthony “Rumble” Johnson, himself no stranger to   issues. Just 144 seconds after his failure to make the proscribed limit of 205 pounds, DC returned to the scale shortly before the expiration of the   time cutoff. He miraculously hit the weight limit on the nose. Strangely, when Johnson, a former welterweight who boasts a win at heavyweight over a former UFC champion, took to the scales the reading registered 203. 8, precisely 1. 2 pounds below the limit —  the same amount Cormier “lost” in less than three minutes.  Rather than scale skullduggery, ESPN’s Brett Okamoto takes a crack at solving the case of the missing weight by pointing to a       prevarication. “Cormier ( ) who cuts a good amount of weight to compete at 205 pounds, may have used an old wrestling trick to lose 1. 2 pounds in such a short amount of time,” Okamoto writes. “During the second   UFC officials held a towel out in front of Cormier, who had stripped off all his clothes. Cormier clearly pushed down on the towels, which would presumably offset his weight slightly. ” Fighters employ unusual measures to make weight. Desmond Green, fighting on UFC 210’s undercard, once described to Breitbart Sports how he cut his dreadlocks to make weight. Cormier wished such an option existed for him at the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008. He made the 211.  limit. Then his kidneys failed. The medical event prevented him from competing and nearly killed him. That Daniel Cormier competed in his twenties rather than his thirties. And he did so at a weight limit nearly seven pounds higher than the one he encountered on Friday. A      who did not look outsized in dispatching Frank Mir, Antonio “Big Foot” Silva, and Josh Barnett —  none exactly small for their division —  at heavyweight appears like a skeleton at the scales as a light heavyweight. But even Skelator Cormier initially failed to make weight. His Daniel Cormier Diet, surely now as   as anything peddled by Jenny Craig, shed more than a pound in less than a commercial break. At that rate, the Daniel Cormier Diet figures to lose fatties 50 pounds every two hours. Alas, like most    products, the diet wins its fair share of skeptics seeing it as snake oil. But people watching scales, whether athletic commissions or unathletic gargantuans, see what they want to see.",0

67057,HealthCare.gov Will Add ‘Simple Choice’ Plans in Effort to Improve Value - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   When the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance marketplace opens in two weeks, many consumers will have a new option for the law’s fourth   period: standardized health plans that cover basic services without a deductible. With many health plans on the marketplace coming with deductibles in the thousands of dollars, consumers have complained that they were getting little benefit beyond coverage for catastrophic problems. The new standardized options are meant to address that concern  —   to ensure that “enrollees receive some upfront value for their premium dollars,” as the Obama administration said. “Too many people, especially people on   plans, are still struggling to afford the care they need,” Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said, praising the new effort. But the new plans could still be costly. While the federal government specifies deductibles,   and other    costs for the standardized options, it does not limit premiums, which in most cases are still regulated by state insurance commissioners. The administration has said it does not expect the standardized options to have a significant effect on premiums in 2017. Federal officials say the new option will simplify shopping under the Affordable Care Act by reducing variation among plans, and consumer advocates like the idea. The standardized options will be identified on HealthCare. gov with the label “Simple Choice. ” Open enrollment begins Nov. 1 and runs through Jan. 31. People without health insurance next year face possible tax penalties that could exceed $700 a person. “This is one more tool that will make it easier for consumers to select the right plan,” said Marjorie K. Connolly, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services. Sandy H. Ahn, a researcher at the Health Policy Institute of Georgetown University, said the “standardized plans will allow consumers to make more of an    comparison. ” Administration officials did not say how many such plans will be available, in which states they will be offered or how much they will cost. The government encouraged but did not require insurers to offer standardized options. The standardized version of a midlevel silver plan has a $3, 500 deductible, but primary care and specialty care visits, outpatient mental health services and prescription drugs are generally exempt from the deductible. In other words, consumers may face   but they do not have to meet the deductible before the insurance company starts to pay for such services. On HealthCare. gov, the administration intends to introduce the idea of standardized options by describing Simple Choice as “the easiest way to shop for plans. ” “All Simple Choice plans in the same category (like Silver) have exactly the same core benefits, deductibles and ” states a message to be displayed on the federal website. “When viewing Simple Choice plans, you can focus on other important features that may be different: monthly premiums, additional services covered, doctor and hospital networks. ” The Obama administration is still struggling to keep the Affordable Care Act affordable for many consumers. State officials have approved rate increases of 25 percent or more for many plans in 2017, after finding that insurers lost tens of millions of dollars in the exchanges. Aetna, UnitedHealth and other insurers have pulled back from the public marketplace, leaving consumers in many states with fewer choices. Under the standardized version of a silver plan,   would be $30 for a visit to a primary care doctor, $65 for a visit to a specialist, $15 for a generic prescription drug, $50 for a preferred   drug and $100 for a nonpreferred   drug. Consumers may be responsible for up to 40 percent of the cost of specialty drugs, including certain   medicines for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. For the   families, the charges would be lower. Federal officials said they had studied several   exchanges  —   in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon and Vermont  —   that provide standardized options. Peter V. Lee, the executive director of the California exchange, said standardized options had contributed to the stability and success of the marketplace there. “Californians seeking coverage through the marketplace can easily compare health plans, knowing that every health plan has the same   levels and benefits,” Mr. Lee said. Insurers generally dislike efforts to standardize health plans. Standardized options “increase the complexity of the   process” by adding one more factor for consumers to consider, said America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group. In a letter this month to the Obama administration, Anthem, one of the nation’s largest insurers, said, “Standardized benefit designs threaten to commoditize insurance and stifle innovation, while potentially misleading consumers. ” The administration said insurers still had discretion to vary many features that would not be standardized.",0

The Daily Beast is reporting that Trump s team is so disgusted by this, Trump s aides and advisers are actually mocking him and making jokes about how they can get him to shut the hell up.In response to Trump s tweet about Rosenstein this morning, in which Trump said I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! , an anonymous  senior Trump administration official  reportedly joked: Has anyone read his Miranda rights?

42807, Bernie Sanders Sums Up The Disastrous GOP Presidential Race In One Brutal Sentence (VIDEO),"Democratic Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders appeared on MSNBC s The Rachel Maddow Show this week and summed up the entire disastrous GOP race for President in one glorious sentence:  the Republican Party today now is a joke, maintained by a media which really does not force them to discuss their issues. In a show that aired on Wednesday night, Maddow invited Sanders to comment on Trump s comments to fellow MSNBC host Chris Matthews that there  should be some kind of punishment  for women who have abortions. Sanders recoiled at the comments, stating unequivocally: Shameful is understating that position. First of all, to me, and most Americans, women have the right to control their own bodies. But to punish a woman, for having an abortion, is beyond comprehension. One would have to say: what is on Donald Trump s mind? I don t know what world this person lives in. The interview continues with Sanders crushing each pillar of the Republican race, one after another. Until finally, Maddow asks Sanders how he feels about the GOP seeming to split, with the potential for the convention to refuse to endorse the winner of the Primaries. It s worth seeing Sander s full reply, which absolutely nails the crisis at the heart of the GOP and conservative media today: Well, uh, first of all, I don t necessarily take at value   face value what they say.  I think at the end of the day, they probably will come together.But the other point, I think the more   the deeper point, Rachel, is the Republican Party today has moved very, very far to the right.  Uh, they are way out of touch with where the American people are.And I think if we had a media in this country that was really prepared to look at what the Republicans actually stood for rather than quoting every absurd remark of Donald Trump, talking about Republican Party, talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the top two tenths of 1 percent, cuts to Social Security and Medicare, Medicaid, a party which with few exceptions, doesn t even acknowledge the reality of climate change, let alone do anything about it, a party which is not prepared to stand with women in the fight for pay equity, a party that is not prepared to do anything about a broken criminal justice system or a corrupt campaign finance system, I think, to be honest with you   and I just don t, you know, say this rhetorically, this is a fringe party.  It is a fringe party.  Maybe they get 5, 10 percent of the vote.What you really need in this country is a progressive party standing with the working class and the middle class of this country.  And yes, a conservative party that, you know, has, you know, is more fiscally conservative.  That is where we should be as a country.But the Republican Party today now is a joke, maintained by a media which really does not force them to discuss their issues.So that   that s my two cents on that. The Republican Party is in crisis. It s candidates have pulled so far to the right that even Ann Coulter is having a wobble, and it s hard to see how they could possibly gain the support of the wider American public in time for Election 2016.While the candidates  daily horrifying comments might be making lots of front page news, they would be foolish to expect this press attention to turn into votes   at least, not for them. There is such a thing as bad press. The revulsion by the majority of common sense Americans at the GOP parade of bigotry, sexism and theocratic zealotry could well crush the party come voting day   and the party will be left in tatters. It s grassroots to the right of Ghengis Khan, while the nation is moving far enough in a progressive direction that a democratic socialist like Bernie Sanders is able to maintain a solid campaign. Something has to give, and as yet the GOP has no answer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vQP7Hy42z8Featured image via screencapture ",1

21227,Under-pressure Deutsche Bank reports surprise profit BUT 14% rise in debt trading revenues way behind Barclays & Co.,"— Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) October 27, 2016 
Deutsche Bank AG’s surprise third-quarter profit was overshadowed by Chief Executive Officer John Cryan failing to dispel concerns that uncertainty tied to a U.S. settlement will continue to linger. 
Net income was 256 million euros ($279 million) after a loss of 6.01 billion euros a year ago, the Frankfurt-based lender said on Thursday. That beat an average 394 million-euro loss forecast by 14 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. Trading revenue rose 10 percent, driven by debt and currencies, the biggest source of income, also beating estimates. 
Cryan, 55, has struggled to stem a slide in shares and maintain client confidence after the U.S. Department of Justice last month requested $14 billion to settle a probe into faulty securities, more than twice the bank’s legal provisions. Some investors have called for deeper cost cuts amid concern that the lender will have to raise capital even after eliminating thousands of jobs. 
“This is a small step on the path to improvement, but there are still many potholes in the road,” said Ulf Moritzen, who helps manage about 2.4 billion euros, including Deutsche Bank shares, at Aramea Asset Management in Hamburg, Germany. “The mood will be pretty depressed until the big settlements are out of the way.”",1
26924,NAACP: Sessions’ Voter Fraud Prosecutions Were ‘Intimidating’ to Voters,"The organized left’s kitchen sink tactic seen throughout the week against Senator Jeff Sessions’ ( ) nomination for the next U. S. Attorney General included a bold effort tell the Senate Judiciary Committee directly that the nominee’s record of prosecuting federal voter fraud defendants served as an example of voter intimidation. [The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund’s opposition campaign formally expanded this week to include the promotion of a letter from former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick (D) who previously served as a staff lawyer for the organization before advancing to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the Clinton Administration.  The document, directed to Senate Judiciary Committee leadership, charged that Sessions’ judgment should be questioned after bringing a case against three black, Alabama voters for what Patrick describes was an effort to “help someone else to vote or advise them how to vote —  even if and when they ask for such help. ” The defendants named in the case (the Perry County Three) were Albert Turner, Spencer Hogue, Jr. and Evelyn Turner. Patrick reports that he served as counsel to Mr. Hogue. The former governor further charged that the case was an example of Sessions’ “extraordinary   activism” and noted that Sessions targeted his efforts on “black voters and only where white incumbents were losing political ground. ” Finally, the letter argued that the former U. S. Attorney’s decision to give 20 local government witnesses armed protection when traveling to testify led some to believe there was a “campaign to intimidate” the group into “believing that voter assistance was illegal. ” The submission to the committee triggered a response from another former DOJ civil rights attorney on Thursday. J. Christian Adams, Public Interest Legal Foundation President, alerted senators to a number of “legal and factual inaccuracies” Patrick had offered that should not be relied on. The nonprofit called foul on Patrick’s attempt to reframe the case as a crackdown on lawful voter assistance and reminded committee members what the actual, alleged statutory violations were —  mail fraud and voting more than once in a federal election. Adams argued that perhaps Patrick’s decision to redefine the case could be attributed to his potential view “that since the voters and the [ballot] harvesters were merely of the same race, no crime occurred because the harvesters knew who the voters should (or would) support. ” The defendants initially requested the judge acquit them and then later offered to plead guilty to the election crimes —  facts Adams notes were omitted in Patrick’s written statement and severely undercut the claim that Sessions should not be trusted, given his record of bringing the unnecessary case. The NAACP narrative of the week was further challenged when a son of the Perry County Three, Albert Turner, Jr. endorsed Sessions for the post of attorney general, as reported by Breitbart News. Turner admitted there will be some policy differences between himself and an AG Sessions, but he and others in the “civil rights community can work” him if given the chance. He added that there is no longstanding ill will between them, stating that  . S. Attorney Sessions had “a job to do” when prosecuting his parents. “He is not a racist,” Turner added. The defendants were acquitted by the jury at the time. The NAACP letter writing campaign did not end with Governor Patrick. Breitbart News previously reported on an open letter effort circulated and signed by more than 1, 200 law professors to oppose the nomination. “Nothing in Senator Sessions’ public life since 1986 has convinced us that he is a different man than the    attorney who was deemed too racially insensitive to be a federal district court judge,” the letter charged. Outside of the war of written words, NAACP President Cornell William Brooks was notoriously arrested during a   at Senator Sessions’ Mobile, Alabama office on Wednesday, according to a recent Breitbart News report. The message was clear: “We are asking the senator to withdraw his name for consideration as attorney general or for the   Donald Trump, to withdraw the nomination,” Brooks said, according to CNN. After posting bail, Brooks joined a Friday morning conference call with top leadership from the   The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, La Raza, Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and Al Sharpton from the National Action Network to retell his experience. Recent IRS Form 990s revealed that the combined salaries for the speakers on the call exceed $1. 5 million dollars. Sharpton promised that like the NAACP   the National Action Network intends to scatter occupiers in each of the offices of senators voting for Sessions’ confirmation and “may stay awhile”. The conference call   a number of key talking points against the senator, with   President Sherrilyn Ifill charging, “the question is not ‘is Jeff Sessions a racist?’ The question is whether we can trust him to enforce civil rights laws. ” MALDEF President Thomas Saenz added that “it takes more than a law degree to be attorney general,” questioning Sessions’ competence to fairly enforce civil rights laws. When asked by National Public Radio if any on the call had direct talks with Sessions for the purpose of smoothing out differences, Wade Henderson of the Leadership Conference explained that the senator had not yet reached out. Assuming a successful confirmation, Christian Adams predicted to Breitbart News’ Lee Stranahan that   agitation will only increase from within the Justice Department. Due to the limited number of appointees Sessions would be able to place, he will be entering a “nest of vipers” as it regards to career bureaucrats acting upon their personal legal and political views.

11585,Japanese man kills wife and priestess sister with sword in bizarre family feud: media,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese man wielding a sword killed his sister, a Shinto priestess, on the grounds of a Tokyo shrine, then stabbed his wife to death before committing suicide, police and media said.

47214,Monument to designer of AK-47 rifle scarred by sculptor's lapse,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Workers on Friday cut out part of a new monument to Mikhail Kalashnikov, inventor of the Soviet Union s legendary AK-47 assault rifle, after eagle-eyed Russians noticed that it mistakenly depicted a German weapon of World War Two. Just three days ago, the monument to the creator of one of Russia s best known export brands was unveiled with much fanfare in central Moscow. A metal bas-relief behind a statue of Kalashnikov depicts the AK-47 and other weapons all supposedly designed by the engineer, who died in 2013. But on Friday, embarrassed sculptor Salavat Shcherbakov had to admit that among them was the Sturmgewehr 44 (StG 44) assault rifle used by Nazi troops at the end of World War II.  We will rectify this,  Shcherbakov said in comments broadcast by state-run Rossiya 24 channel.  It looks like this (mistake) sneaked in from the Internet.   By Friday evening a square hole gaped where the German rifle had been depicted in the bas-relief. Kalashnikov s weapon, created in 1947, does have a striking resemblance to German arms designer Hugo Schmeissers s StG 44 rifle, created in 1942, although they have major design differences. Kalashnikov was known to have said he had heard speculation that he had copied the German rifle.  Vladislav Kononov, executive director of the Russian Military and Historical Society, was cited by Russian media as saying that the fact that angry Russians had spotted the error in the relief disproved that. Many had earlier vented their disapproval on social media.  Every cloud has its silver lining - thanks to this mistake ... a myth has been destroyed that Kalashnikov borrowed some elements of his invention from his foreign colleagues,   he said. The AK-47, the small-arms mainstay of Russia s armed forces for over 60 years, is called by some experts the most effective weapon ever made. Every fifth firearm in the world is a Kalashnikov, with more than 70 million of the assault rifles produced over the past 60 years, the Kalashnikov Concern manufacturer said on its website. Kalashnikovs are in service in 50 foreign armies, it added. ",0
