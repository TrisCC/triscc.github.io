34148, Hateful Letter To Food Bank PROVES We Need Food Stamps (IMAGE),"A few days before Thanksgiving, a food bank in Central Texas received a letter that was so hateful it could only have been written by a Trump supporter.Dear Foodbank:I don t understand who these poor folks are that need food. I assume they consist primarily of illegals, who come to Texas for  free stuff.  And of course, our unemployed Africans, who find work too much trouble, especially when they can collect the equivalent of $40,000 a year on welfare, and other  benefits  offered to the unfit, the lazy, and the under-educated and of course, the drug addicts.I expect that most who need food are marching around whining that the congenital liar, Hillary Rodham Clinton, lost the election. Too bad; How sad.I also wonder if your organization is not one of those Phoney-Baloney, so-called  charities,  designed primarily to provide a good living to its organizers.In sort, no way.Signed,Citizen RobespierreNaturally, the food bank was mortified. The lack of empathy was disturbing,  says Paul Gaither, marketing and communications director for the Food Bank.  Most of the letters we receive say things like  we don t have anything to contribute  or  please take me off your list,  but this one was a little different. It s important that we don t categorize the people we serve as  takers  Gaither said.  Most of the people we serve have fallen on hard times or are the working poor who just can t make ends meet, and that can happen to anyone. Source: GivingCityAustinBefore I tackle how this proves we need food stamps, let s talk about the misconceptions in the surprisingly literate letter. First off, food should never be treated as a luxury. You can absolutely not call yourself pro-life while at the same time advocating that people should starve. Of the 37 million people who are fed every year by food banks, 14 million of them are children and 3 million are seniors.As for undocumented immigrants, well, they aren t crossing the border to eat at food banks. They are crossing the border, for the most part, to work and that s what they do. Collectively, undocumented immigrants contribute almost $12 billion each year to our country because they pay taxes and get nothing in return. We should be thanking them instead of sending hateful notes about them.It s not just unemployed people who need food banks, so do people who work minimum wage jobs. Texas happens to be among the states with the very lowest wages. Only Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi have lower wages. In other words, in states like Texas, laziness has nothing to do with the ability to put food on the table.Now, back to the food stamps argument. One Republican argument has always been that if the government stops offering a social safety net, private charities will pick up the slack. While that sounds like a beautiful idea (sort of), it s simply not true. People s ability to eat should not depend on the whims of people, nor should it depend on the economy or whether a charity can effectively market itself. We tried that in the past. It didn t work.Instead, that time in history proved that privately funded charities can be both bigoted and very selective in who they cover. If you can imagine the writer of this letter, for example, giving to any charity, do you honestly think (s)he d give to a charity that serviced minority areas? No. That s where government comes in. Making sure Americans have enough food is our moral prerogative. Relying on bigots like Citizen Robespierre should be out of the question, no matter who is hungry.As for the Central Texas Food Bank, well, they are a damn good charity. They score 100 out of 100 on Charity Navigator. The vast majority of the people they serve are not homeless. 1/3 of the recipients are white.Featured image via State Farm/Flickr.",1

33796,Netanyahu lobbies world powers to stem Iraqi Kurd setbacks,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is lobbying world powers to prevent further setbacks to Iraqi Kurds as they lose ground to Baghdad s army, Israeli officials say. Israel has been the only major power to endorse statehood for the Kurds, partly, say analysts, because it sees the ethnic group - whose population is split among Iraq, Turkey, Syria and Iran - as a buffer against shared adversaries. Iraqi armed forces retook the oil-rich Kirkuk region this week, following a Sept. 25 referendum on Kurdish independence that was rejected by Baghdad, delivering a blow to the Kurds  statehood quest.      Israeli officials said Netanyahu raised the Iraqi Kurds  plight in phone calls with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week and with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.  It has also come up in his contacts with France and the Israeli national security adviser, Meir Ben-Shabbat, has been discussing the matter with Trump administration officials in Washington this week, the officials said. A Netanyahu government official, who declined to be named, given the sensitivity of Israel-Kurdish ties, suggested Israel had security interests in Kurdistan, given its proximity to Israel s enemies in Tehran and Damascus.  This (territory) is a foothold. It s a strategic place,  the official said without providing further detail. He said Israel wanted to see Iraqi Kurds provided with the means to protect themselves, adding:   It would be best if someone gave them weaponry, and whatever else, which we cannot give, obviously.      Israel has maintained discreet military, intelligence and business ties with Kurds since the 1960s, in the absence of open ties between their autonomous region in northern Iraq and Israel.  Netanyahu s recent lobbying has focused on Kurdish ambitions in Iraq, where the central Baghdad government has grown closer to Israel s foe Iran.            The issue at present is ... to prevent an attack on the Kurds, extermination of the Kurds and any harm to them, their autonomy and region, something that Turkey and Iran and internal Shi ite and other powers in Iraq and part of the Iraqi government want,  Netanyahu s intelligence minister, Israel Katz, told Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM on Friday.   It was not clear to what extent Netanyahu s outreach may have been solicited by the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, which shies away from public engagement with Israel, worried about further alienating Arab neighbours.    The United Nations has voiced concern at reports that civilians, mainly Kurds, were being driven out of parts of northern Iraq retaken by Iraqi forces and their houses and businesses looted and destroyed.  The prime minister is certainly engaging the United States, Russia, Germany and France to stop the Kurds from being harmed,  Katz said.   Another Israeli official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, framed Netanyahu s efforts as a moral imperative.   They (Kurds) are a deeply pro-Western people who deserve support,  he said.  ",0
35960," West Virginia Republicans Legalize Raw Milk, Get Sick After Drinking It In Celebration (VIDEO)","Long may their heaves remind them of just how idiotic they are.A group of West Virginia Republicans reaped what they sowed this week after one of their own brought in some raw milk to drink in celebration of a bill they passed into law weeks ago making raw milk legal to drink across the state.According to the Food And Drug Administration:Milk and milk products provide a wealth of nutrition benefits. But raw milk can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious health risks to you and your family. According to an analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), between 1993 and 2006 more than 1500 people in the United States became sick from drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk. In addition, CDC reported that unpasteurized milk is 150 times more likely to cause foodborne illness and results in 13 times more hospitalizations than illnesses involving pasteurized dairy products.Despite this warning, state GOP Rep. Pat McGeehan and others drank the raw milk anyway and became sick afterwards, thus making famed scientist Louis Pasteur roll over in his grave.Pasteur is the French chemist and microbiologist who discovered pasteurization to kill harmful bacteria and microorganisms that cause foodborne sicknesses. There s definitely some other colleagues that have similar symptoms that I ve been experiencing,  McGeehan reported.However, like most times Republicans are wrong, McGeehan and his colleagues are in denial that the milk is the cause of their illness, even though they only began reporting feeling sick AFTER drinking the raw milk that the FDA advises people NOT to drink because it makes people sick.The ill lawmakers say that their Republican colleague Scott Cadle brought in the raw milk and McGeehan happened to be in the hallway when Cadle approached him to share a drink. [Cadle] caught me in the hallway, offered a cup to me, and you want to try to be a gentleman,  McGeehan said.  I had a small sip and walked away and tossed the rest of it. Gee, if raw milk isn t dangerous why toss it after a  small sip,  Mr. McGeehan?McGeehan claims that a stomach bug is the real cause of the lawmakers praying to the porcelain God and even made another dubious claim. I don t think it s any riskier than eating raw oysters or anything like that,  McGeehan said of the raw milk.Cue yet another warning from the FDA:You can get seriously ill and even die from eating raw oysters contaminated with Vibrio vulnificus   a bacterium commonly found in waters where oysters are cultivated such as the Gulf of Mexico. Vibrio vulnificus is found in higher concentrations during the summer months as water becomes warmer.Vibrio vulnificus bacteria is not a result of pollution, so although oysters should always be obtained from reputable sources, eating oysters from  clean  waters or in reputable restaurants with high turnover does not provide protection.Seriously, who elected these dumbasses to political office?Here s the video via WSAZ.The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources is currently investigating.Featured image via screen capture",1
61724,Germany favors Eurofighter as it seeks to replace Tornado,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German Defence Ministry said on Monday that the European fighter jet was the leading candidate to replace its Tornado jets, which it wants to start phasing out in 2025. The ministry s position appears to contradict that of the German air force, whose chief indicated last month that he preferred Lockheed Martin s F-35, which meets the military s requirements of stealth and long-distance operational capabilities. In a letter to a Greens lawmaker who had inquired about the deliberations, the ministry said the F-35 and Boeing s F-15 and F-18 fighters were secondary options.  The indicated view of the inspector of the air force that the F-35 Lightning II is an especially suitable successor to the Tornado system is not the position of the federal government,  Deputy Defence Minister Ralf Brauksiepe wrote in the letter. The Eurofighter Typhoon is a joint project between British defense group BAE, France s Airbus and Italy s Finmeccanica. The ministry s preference for the Typhoon is no surprise; France and Germany said earlier this year they would work together to develop a new European fighter, as they expand cooperation on defense and security [nL8N1K43JS]. Many German allies in Europe, including Norway, the Netherlands, Britain, Italy, Turkey and Denmark have selected the F-35 and some have received initial deliveries. Belgium is expected to make a decision next year. The contract to replace Germany s 85 Tornado jets, which go out of service around 2030, could be worth billions of euros. A new fighter purchase would have to be approved by parliament in the next two years and a contract signed by 2020 or 2021 to ensure deliveries by 2025. No final decision is likely before a new government is formed, following elections this past September. Chancellor Angela Merkel will open talks on Wednesday with the Social Democrats (SPD) on renewing their alliance, which has ruled Germany since 2013. She turned to the SPD after efforts to form a coalition with the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats failed.     ",0
52561, Trump Fan Violently Attacks Comedian For Harmless Joke (VIDEO),"Comedian John Caparulo was in the middle of a perfectly normal standup act at The Comedy & Magic Club in Hermosa Beach, California when someone was apparently too stupid to get his joke about Donald Trump and reacted violently.

Some people think it looks like a dick but I think they re saving that design for Trump s monument.  Though the majority of the audience laughed uproariously, two women decided that Mr. Caparulo was a goddamn traitor. Fuck you,  one of the women yelled, apparently unable to summon enough of her insignificant brainpower to form a snappy comeback. No fuck you stupid, what are you his fucking mom? Get the fuck out of here,  Caparulo replied, seeminly bemused by this woman s shock that someone doesn t like the least popular president in American history.  Oh god, am I the first one to dislike Trump? Oh my god, I must ve invented disliking Trump  Fucking break up my show lady, you can come up here and do this shit.

36795,Civil War in the GOP: Trump Leading “Long Experiment in Populism… New Republican Party”,"
Win or lose, Trump has left his mark, and America has changed.
On the eve of the election, many Republican insiders and loyal commentators are acknowledging what has become apparent – that rise of Trump signals not just a different 2016 cycle, but an entirely new constituency – one defined by populism, by trade, by class. by the impact on jobs and economics.
Charles Krauthammer stated on Fox News that Trump is the new power broker in the GOP and the de facto “king maker” – regardless of who wins the election. The demographics of the party have changed:

Interestingly, Bill Clinton also gets it. The former president has been on the stump – ostensibly to differentiate his wife from President Obama – pointing out the fact that the middle class has been abandoned, and that these desperate people are turning to populist because they have lost something tangible in the last eight years.
As The Daily Sheeple reported :
A leaked Democratic fundraising speech Bill Clinton gave back in 2015 shows the former president telling donors that thanks to Obama, lower-income whites have lower life expectancies because they “don’t have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning” now.
Bill is tacitly acknowledging the impact that terrible trade deals have had on the American economy and jobs over the last 30 years…
Not only is Bill trying to sound like a straight-talking mix of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, he is acknowledging the same new party identities that voters have assumed.
While Hillary may take the electoral college votes handily enough, the popular votes will reflect a sentiment of anger and unrest in the population.
As the NY Times noted :
[Democrats/Hillary campaign] have effectively swapped much of their working-class white base for the so-called rising demographic of millennials, nonwhite voters and suburbanites clustered near cities such as Denver, Miami, Las Vegas and Washington.
From watching these communities, it will become clear on Tuesday why Mrs. Clinton’s party enjoys a structural advantage in the Electoral College. But this election may also hasten the day when more of the heartland becomes out of reach, illustrating what Democrats lost as much as what they gained. 
The common thread is that a combination of trade deals and economic policies has destroyed the wealth of “everyday Americans” – shrinking the middle class and piling pressure onto the lower and working classes who must increasingly depend upon government assistance for their survival.

34832,WOW! POPE FRANCES Tells Journalists That People Who Don’t Believe In Man-Made Climate Change Are “Stupid” and “Stubborn”,"Here is a portion of the interview that was conducted by a group of journalists and Pope Frances today:Vatican Insider    I leaned out to greet the children and didn t see the glass, and  pum! The Pope with a smile and an obvious dark bruise framing his left cheek, answers the question on how he feels after the small accident that happened to him in Cartagena. Immediately after the Avianca flight took off from Cartagena, Francis spoke for 38 minutes with journalists on immigration, climate change, Trump s latest measures and the situation in Venezuela. He confirmed that he had a private meeting with the Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, but denied that there was talk of immigration. He expressed his support to Italy for what the country is doing by trying to manage the emergency landings and regulate immigration flows. Here is a list of US Senators who are also Catholics. Their pro-life ratings are listed in front of their names.: Senate100% Mike Johanns, R-Neb.100% Jim Risch, R-Idaho100% David Vitter, R-La.94% Pat Toomey, R-Pa.**68% Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska50% Robert Casey Jr., D-Pa.31% Mary Landrieu, D-La.23% Susan Collins, R-Maine11% Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.4% John Kerry, D-Mass.2% Richard Durbin, D-Ill.2% Tom Harkin, D-Iowa2% Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.2% Patty Murray, D-Wash.2% Jack Reed, D-R.I.1% Robert Menendez, D-N.J.0% Mark Begich, D-Alaska0% Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.0% Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.0% Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.Does anyone see a pattern here? Yet, no open condemnation for these lawmakers who actually have the power to stop the barbaric practice of abortion by the Pope. Italy is starting to feel the climate change. There have been many deaths in recent days and so much damage  Why is it that governments are delaying this realization, whereas on other issues they keep soliciting, like on the Korean arms race, for example?How ironic that the Pope would suggest climate-change deniers who ve been screaming that phony climate change data and peddlers are part of a scheme to extort money from citizens that will somehow  fix  the NOT resolved science behind  man-made climate change. I have heard of the abolition of this law, but I have not been able to read the articles on how and why this decision was taken. I do not know the situation well. However, detaching young people from their family won t bear any good fruit for young people or the family. This law comes from the executive and not from Parliament: if that is the case, I hope that they will think it over again a little bit. I have heard the President of the United States speak, who presents himself as a pro-life. If he is a good pro-life, he understands the importance of family and life: the unity of the family must be defended. When young people feel exploited, they ultimately feel hopeless. And who steals it? Drugs, other kinds of addictions, suicide  achievable when your roots are cut off. Anything that goes against the roots steals hope. ",1

40686, Trump Will ‘Torture’ Sessions Every Day Until He Resigns: Report,"Trump apparently will continue the feud he started with Jeff Sessions when he said he thought Sessions had been very unfair in recusing himself from the Russia investigation. He wants someone who is going to be 100 percent blindly loyal (meaning someone who will stop any and all investigations into him and his family and open investigations into Hillary and the Democrats), and clearly, Sessions isn t it. So, according to one of Trump s close advisers, he will torture Sessions until he resigns:He wants to fire him but he doesn t want the confrontation. He doesn t mind the long negative storyline. He will torture him every single day. When Trump gets all butthurt like this, he focuses his ire on the perceived guilty party and doesn t let it go until they either cave or someone manages to convince him to let it go. Sessions, thus far, has maintained that he will not resign, and, well, Trump just can t have that.According to Politico, Trump has been whining up one side and down the other about Sessions  decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation to anyone who will listen. Not only did Trump say that was unfair to him, but he also said that, if he d known Sessions was going to take the job and then recuse himself, he would never have  given  him the job in the first place. To Trump, recusal in this situation is a grave abdication of responsibility and a betrayal of trust when the person doing so is supposed to be on Trump s side (if they re an opponent, of course, they must recuse over the slightest possible conflict).Sessions, for his part, doesn t seem to know what the problem is. One person close to him said that they ve spoken to people in the West Wing and nobody understands why Trump is doing this. But Trump, never one to let go of a grudge until his enemy is completely vanquished (and sometimes, not even then), reportedly wants to see how Sessions will respond to things like mockery and humiliation.If Sessions does resign, Trump will eventually turn his ire on someone else. He wants sycophants, not people who will do their jobs.Featured image via Michael Reynolds and Mark Wilson/Getty Images",1

Its rise in use prompted Oxford University Press to name it word of the year. “Postfaktisch” is Germany’s top word of 2016, according to the Society for the German Language. The organization, a   agency, bases its yearly choices on significance, rather than frequency. Third place went to “Silvesternacht,” or New Year’s Eve, which has taken an unpleasant meaning since hundreds of women in a German city were attacked as they celebrated the end of 2015. Across the Atlantic,   chose “surreal,” which it says was trending in moments of crisis this year. People who saw “The Lobster,” including our movie critic, used it in the original sense, to describe artistic expression, too. But a word Austria is celebrating stands out among them all. The yearlong campaign for the presidency, which nearly gave the country its first   leader since World War II, was the basis for the “postponement of the repeat runoff of the election of the federal president. ” It’s otherwise known as “Bundespräsidentenstichwahlwiederholungsverschiebung. ” Palko Karasz contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.

54744, Kim Davis Utters Four Words To Describe Obama’s Speech – Gets Burned Alive For It (VIDEO),"Rowan county clerk Kim Davis already had her five minutes of fame; her time is over and done with. Or is it? At, least, it was until some Republican by the name of Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) gave tickets to President Obama s last State of the Union address to the Family Research Council, who then, in turn, gave the exclusive rights to one of the tickets to Mrs. Davis.Now, unfortunately, her five minutes of fame has been extended to six minutes. Heck, we wouldn t even grant her that right if she wasn t one of the top trending topics in the internet chatter world Tuesday night. But, the reality is, she is. For some reason, people can t get enough of Kim Davis   she must have all the makings of a star.A reporter caught up with Davis after Obama concluded his last remarks for the night, and uttered just four words of what she thought about her experience: It was a speech. En exclusivit  mondiale, Kim Davis pour l'AFP. ""Je voulais encourager tous les Chr tiens"" pic.twitter.com/yoCzflde2m  Ivan Couronne (@ivancouronne) January 13, 2016While not the kindest reply (it certainly was much more of a speech), it also wasn t the most thought-provoking either. But, hey, what else do you expect coming from the mouth of Kim Davis? Here is a suggestion for Kim, in four words:  just do your job.In all fairness, the internet was much harsher to her than her characterization of the president s speech ever was, and it s not even close. While it s never a good thing to be mean, she must have known a good roasting was coming her way.Here are a few of the top (and funniest) comments she received on the internet after so brazenly deciding to show her face on the most important day in politics.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Uproxx.Pic via Uproxx.Pic via Uproxx.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.What can we say? Kim keeps showing up in the limelight and we, as a people, continue taking the bait. She may not be relevant, but she sure is a target   no one can disagree with that. Her facial expressions were probably some of the most scrutinized, right up there with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. He appeared virtually emotionless throughout the entire speech, with a few slight movements here and there. It was almost like there was an unannounced contest between him and Kim Davis on who could appear to be the least interested in whatever the president was saying. Maybe they were playing chicken with each other; we don t know. What is clear is that Kim Davis will forever be in our memories, if not in our hearts.Featured image via screen capture.",1
40422,‘Hamilton’ Inc.: The Path to a Billion-Dollar Broadway Show - The New York Times,"Just how many Hamiltons can “Hamilton” make? Broadway’s new blockbuster has only been open for 10 months, but already, this   musical about America’s founding fathers is one of the great successes in recent theatrical history. The show’s cast members were invited to the White House and have become regular guests on   talk shows.   Miranda, the musical’s creator, was on the cover of Rolling Stone. Fans and enterprising   camp outside the theater around the clock, hoping to snag   seats. Tickets are almost impossible to come by, except those resold at highly   prices. And celebrities have streamed in: Beyoncé. Barbra. Bernie. All that enthusiasm means a lot of money for the men and women who brought the show to Broadway. Months ago, “Hamilton” recouped the $12. 5 million it cost to mount. It is now making an estimated $600, 000 a week in profit, and every indication is that its touring productions, which begin in Chicago in September and in San Francisco next March, will be highly profitable, too. Producers and investors together stand to make tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr. Miranda will become quite wealthy. And a diverse group of collaborators  —   from the lighting designer to Mr. Miranda’s    father  —   will share in the bounty. Even if “Hamilton” isn’t playing in Bangkok decades after its debut (as was the case with “Phantom of the Opera”) it’s not unreasonable to expect that Mr. Miranda’s unlikely hit will ultimately generate upward of $1 billion in sales. Of course, nothing is certain: Theater history is dotted with fizzled triumphs. (“The Producers,” for example, was a   on Broadway and toured, but lost steam.) After the June 12 Tony Awards, “Hamilton” will face a new set of challenges, with new cast members and new markets. But there is a demonstrated path to riches for the few musicals able to translate Broadway success into   and international popularity: “The Lion King” and “Phantom” each claims to have grossed more than $6 billion worldwide, and “Wicked” has passed $4 billion. Forecasting the future for “Hamilton” is risky, but the show’s current fortunes, and the model provided by other shows, are instructive. Here, based on documents filed with government agencies and interviews with people familiar with various aspects of the musical’s finances, is a look at how “Hamilton” makes money and where that money goes. ‘The revolution’s happening in New York.’ On Broadway, “Hamilton” is consistently selling out all 1, 321 seats at the Richard Rodgers Theater and is currently grossing about $1. 9 million a week in ticket sales. Simply by maintaining that pace, the show would bring in nearly $100 million a year (that’s grosses, not profits). But there is reason to expect that figure to rise. In a bid to blunt profiteering  —   the widespread scalping of tickets at highly   prices  —   the show may soon raise prices above the current ceiling of $475 for premium seating. At $100 million a year, the Broadway production of the show would pass the $1 billion mark in a decade. The show’s current pace will be tough to sustain, but not unimaginable  —   “Wicked” this year set a record by reaching the $1 billion mark on Broadway in just over 12 years, and “Hamilton,” although running in a smaller theater, has higher ticket prices. ‘We create. You just wanna move our money around.’ The hottest ticket on Broadway cost, on average, $172 during the week that ended June 5. But that’s just what the initial purchaser paid. Many theatergoers pay considerably more by purchasing resold tickets on sites like StubHub, Craigslist and Ticketmaster. Those tickets are being listed for as much as $5, 018 each, but most are sold for considerably less. The average resale of “Hamilton” tickets on StubHub is roughly $872, according to a New York Times analysis, a markup of $700 above the current average original ticket sale price. For any given performance, roughly 13 to 22 percent of the seats at the Richard Rodgers  —   somewhere between 180 and 300 tickets  —   are available on the secondary market, according to The Times’s research and interviews with ticket sellers. So for each performance of “Hamilton,” ticket sellers and brokers are reaping roughly $150, 000. With the Broadway cast putting on more than 400 shows per year, that means these sellers could reap about $60 million per year, just in New York  —   money the producers, investors and Mr. Miranda will never see. ‘Tomorrow there’ll be more of us.’ If “Hamilton” follows the pattern of other recent theatrical megahits, its profits will substantially increase when it plays outside of New York. The big money goes to shows that globalize by running productions in multiple countries, often at the same time. (“The Phantom of the Opera,” for example, has been mounted in 13 languages in 151 cities in 30 countries.) “Hamilton” is moving quickly to take advantage of its moment. The Chicago production will begin just 13 months after the Broadway opening and run indefinitely. The PrivateBank Theater in Chicago, where “Hamilton” will play, is much bigger than the show’s Broadway house, meaning that even if ticket prices are somewhat lower, revenues could be strong, and that run could nearly double the show’s weekly profitability. “Hamilton” is also planning two separate North American touring productions: one beginning in March in San Francisco, and one beginning in Seattle in 2018. The theaters on the road are likely to price tickets lower than in New York, but many of them hold more people, so these two tours, on top of Chicago, could dramatically increase the show’s current revenues and profits. The show’s producers will soon announce a fifth production, in London, and if “Hamilton” follows the path of other monster musicals, it will eventually explore the possibilities of productions in Asia, Australia or Continental Europe. Profits from foreign productions are difficult to forecast, and given that “Hamilton” is a lyrically dense musical about American history, its appeal outside the United States, and in languages other than English, is uncertain. ‘Can I buy you a drink?’ From   to CDs to books, fans cannot get enough “Hamilton. ” The cast album has sold over 428, 000 copies domestically, according to Nielsen. Track downloads have topped 212, 000   streams from sources like Spotify and Apple Music have eclipsed 365 million. Together, that’s roughly $11 million in gross retail sales. More music is on the way. Mr. Miranda is working with the Roots’ drummer, Questlove, on a new recording of “Hamilton” songs, and more, featuring pop stars like Busta Rhymes, Ben Folds, Regina Spektor and Chance the Rapper. “Hamilton” can even sell books. “Hamilton: The Revolution,” a    book about the creation of the musical by Jeremy McCarter and Mr. Miranda, went on sale in April with a list price of $40. In less than two months, it sold more than 101, 000 copies, according to Nielsen, and hit the No. 1 spot on the New York Times hardcover nonfiction   list. (Other authors have benefited from “Hamilton” fever, too: Ron Chernow’s 2004 biography, which inspired Mr. Miranda to write the musical, has spent 33 weeks on the paperback   list. This fall, Three Rivers Press will publish Jeff Wilser’s   book “Alexander Hamilton’s Guide to Life. ”) Many of those who manage to get inside the Richard Rodgers Theater visit the gift stand, which sells hats, magnets and mugs. And goodies are available even to those who can’t get inside the theater. Bloomingdale’s is selling “Hamilton” apparel in New York, and plans to do the same in other cities as the show tours. Online, there is a thriving market for unlicensed “Hamilton” tchotchkes: perfume, dolls and key chains made by enterprising fans. There is even a beer. Gun Hill Brewing in the Bronx has made a “Hamilton”  pale ale. The brew won’t enrich Mr. Miranda and his team instead, some profits are going to Graham Windham, the social services organization   by Alexander Hamilton’s wife, Eliza. Dave Lopez, a partner at Gun Hill, says, “Anything ‘Hamilton’ sells these days. ” ‘Who provided those funds?’ The vast majority of profits from “Hamilton” is going to the producers and investors who put up the $12. 5 million to finance the show. Jeffrey Seller, the lead producer, will reap big financial rewards. A veteran of other Broadway hits, including “Rent” and Mr. Miranda’s first musical, “In the Heights,” Mr. Seller splits 42 percent of the net profits from the show with its other producers, Jill Furman and Sander Jacobs. (They are not saying how they divvy up their share.) That means the producers are splitting about $13 million annually from the current Broadway production. The producers are also entitled to 3 percent of the adjusted gross from “Hamilton,” which amounts to about $52, 000 weekly, or $2. 7 million annually, from the Broadway production. (Producers commonly get both a royalty and a share of profits.) For Mr. Seller, it doesn’t end there. His production company, Adventureland, is entitled to another 5 percent of net profits, or about $1. 6 million a year, from the current production. Adventureland receives these   torchbearer points in recognition of his role in the show’s development. The investors who backed “Hamilton”  —   a group of about 100 people that includes Robert Greenblatt, the NBC Entertainment chairman, as well as the power publicist Ken Sunshine  —   split another 42 percent of the profits, or about $13 million annually, from the Broadway production. (The list of “Hamilton” investors has not been made public.) Those are big numbers for the theater world, but they are likely to get much bigger in the coming years, as the show opens productions beyond New York. ‘Why do you write like you’re running out of time?’ Mr. Miranda, the show’s    creator, wears an unusual number of hats: He came up with the idea he wrote the music, book and lyrics and he is, for now, the star. That means he gets a salary (as an actor) as well as authorship royalties and profits that ordinarily would be split among multiple people. He is expected to leave the cast this summer and will then lose his salary (an undisclosed amount) but he will continue to receive the royalties and profits for as long as the show runs. He is likely to make at least $6. 4 million from the Broadway production over the next year his earnings will grow considerably when the other productions begin. The show has also dramatically transformed his earning potential. Disney has proved particularly enthusiastic: Mr. Miranda wrote a cantina song for “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” is writing music for the animated film “Moana” and has been cast to star opposite Emily Blunt in a   sequel to “Mary Poppins. ” A film version of “In the Heights,” which had stalled in Hollywood, is back in development and a film version of “Hamilton” is likely. Mr. Miranda is also the ultimate rights holder for “Hamilton. ” After the show’s commercial life ends, he will own the rights for productions in regional theaters and schools, which can generate considerable revenue over time. ‘I never had a group of friends before. I promise that I’ll make y’all proud.’ Mr. Miranda rewards loyalty. The director, choreographer and orchestrator for “Hamilton,” as well as the show’s costume, lighting and sound designers, all worked on “In the Heights. ” All of them  —   and the show’s set designer  —   are entitled to royalties, and all are likely to make millions of dollars over the life of the show. Thomas Kail, the director, has known Mr. Miranda since the two were introduced after both graduated (a few years apart) from Wesleyan University. Mr. Kail helped develop “In the Heights” and “Hamilton. ” He is entitled to 2. 5 percent of the adjusted gross revenue from “Hamilton,” or about $2. 3 million a year just from the New York production. Mr. Kail also receives 1. 5 percent of net profits, currently about another $470, 000 annually. Andy Blankenbuehler, the show’s choreographer, receives 1. 75 percent of gross sales and 0. 5 percent of profits  —   currently totaling $1. 7 million or so annually. Mr. Miranda’s musical partner, Alex Lacamoire, gets just under 1 percent of gross sales, currently about $790, 000 annually. And the show’s costume, lighting and sound designers  —   Paul Tazewell, Howell Binkley and Nevin Steinberg  —   receive between 0. 37 and 0. 5 percent of gross sales, currently worth about $336, 000 to $454, 000 per year. As with all of the royalty and   arrangements associated with “Hamilton,” the value of the creative team’s cut will increase significantly when the productions in Chicago and beyond begin. ‘We’ll give the world to you, and you’ll blow us all away.’ This is the one late addition to the “Hamilton” profit plan: Mr. Seller agreed in April to share some of the show’s earnings with the performers who helped as the musical was being developed. The details are still being ironed out, but probably the   casts at the Public Theater and on Broadway, and perhaps participants in   workshops at the Public Theater, will share 1 percent of the profits from the Broadway production and will also share a portion of the profits of touring productions. The   is likely to affect about 30 people, including not only actors and dancers but also stage managers. It’s not clear how much they would get, but perhaps about $10, 000 a year from the Broadway production alone. That is not a lot of money compared with what others are earning, but it is still significant to performers, many of whom work for relatively low salaries and have long periods between roles. (On Broadway, actors make a   minimum of $1, 900 a week the performers in “Hamilton” are making more than that. But many performers spend much of their careers Off or Off Off Broadway, where salaries are considerably lower.) The “Hamilton” performers worked hard to get a   promise  —   after they were unable to negotiate a deal as the Broadway production was opening, they hired a lawyer to represent them. It took them eight months after the Broadway production opened to win an agreement they had argued that it was not fair, given their contributions to the show, to exclude them from sharing in its success. ‘Don’t forget from whence you came.’ “Hamilton” has proved lucrative for three others who helped along the way: Ron Chernow, a historian whose biography of Alexander Hamilton inspired and formed the basis for the musical the Public Theater, the Off Broadway nonprofit that nurtured the show’s   development and presented its   production and, most surprisingly, Luis A. Miranda Jr.   Miranda’s father. Mr. Chernow, who is the musical’s historical consultant and its tireless champion, gets 1 percent of the show’s adjusted grosses as a royalty  —   currently about $900, 000 a year. The Public Theater, which famously lived for years off the profits from transferring “A Chorus Line” to Broadway, gets 5 percent of the profits and 1 percent of the adjusted gross  —   currently totaling about $2. 5 million a year. The Public says it is putting most of the money into its cash reserves rather than its operating budget. Luis Miranda Jr. a political consultant, is the most unusual beneficiary. He is an unabashed fan of musical theater who collects cast recordings and sings in the car, and he introduced his son to the genre. He is often present at his son’s side, accompanying him to events and helping him manage many aspects of his life and career. He is getting 1 percent of the show’s profits  —   currently about $312, 000 a year. In each case, the value of their share will increase as the show adds productions. ‘The art of the trade. How the sausage gets made.’ Even before the profits or the royalties for “Hamilton” are distributed, there is a more fundamental expense: the cost of putting on the show. Winches and chain motors are $3, 200 a week. Dressers are $20, 000 a week. And electrics and sound cost $28, 000 a week. “Hamilton” pays about $295, 000 per week for the Richard Rodgers, a fee that covers rent as well as the house staff, musicians, stagehands and more. The show’s cast and crew are paid about $220, 000 altogether a week. Advertising costs a relatively low $80, 000 per week, thanks to all the free publicity. But things like taxes, pensions, lawyers and equipment rentals add up. On the scale of Broadway musicals, “Hamilton,” with its modest set and midsize cast, has moderate running costs. All in all, it costs about $650, 000 a week to present the show on Broadway, or about $34 million a year. But it’s proving to be one of the best investments in town.",0
