69694,"Help Through Foster Care, Toward a Career of Helping Others - The New York Times","Shaqueana Peoples’s mother quit on her when she was 15. She had been told by a doctor earlier in 2005 that she had Type 2 diabetes, but her mother ignored doctor’s orders meant to help improve her daughter’s health. She continued to order takeout for dinner, bought frozen meals and did not make sure her daughter took her medicine. Ms. Peoples’s health rapidly deteriorated. She was rushed to the hospital nearly 20 times that year because of medical emergencies. Sick and not attending school, she was assigned a social worker, who also looked for signs of possible parental neglect. Then, during one of a series of routine hospitalizations, hospital employees suggested that her mother place her in the foster care system. “I didn’t have a choice,” Ms. Peoples recalled. “I felt abandoned, like my mother had given up on me. Looking back, she didn’t know how to deal with me as well as her other two kids. She didn’t show me the same kind of love as the others, and I’d been in a rage for years. ” As the middle child, Ms. Peoples had often felt left out, as her mother favored her older brother and younger sister. She said she was rebellious as a teenager, and often got into explosive fights with her mother. Contentious family life was all she knew. Then she was moved into the foster care system. “I was nervous. I was crying. I was conflicted,” she said. “I’d been with my family all my life. I didn’t know how to live with someone that wasn’t part of my family. ” A month after entering an   group home in Brooklyn, Ms. Peoples ran away. Over the next six years, she moved through one group home and six family placements, carrying her belongings from one home to the next in a suitcase provided by her social worker. She preferred to live in a household with other foster children, and not with biological children, because she was treated more fairly, she said. Her frequent moves meant enrolling in different schools and meeting new teachers, and she fell further behind in school with every relocation. She eventually dropped out of school in 10th grade, when she was 17. She became too old for the foster care system at 21. The Children’s Aid Society, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, was there with her during all the moves and has continued to provide her with help since she entered the system 11 years ago. At one point, Children’s Aid helped place Ms. Peoples in a facility in Virginia for children with disabilities, to have her diabetes monitored. The Children’s Aid Society also helped ease her transition out of the foster care system, through a program that provides housing assistance and job training. She learned to drive, enrolled in high school equivalency classes, obtained licenses in certified nursing and home health treatment, applied for subsidized housing and put money into savings. Social workers at the Children’s Aid Society guided her through every step, she said. When she graduated from the Borough of Manhattan Community College with an associate degree in community health, the Children’s Aid Society provided her with $100 in Neediest Cases funds to buy a dress for the graduation ceremony. Ms. Peoples now attends Hunter College, where she receives financial aid through academic scholarships. She qualified for assistance through a program for foster children that supplies $753 a month for school and living expenses. Ms. Peoples also receives Medicaid, $190 in food stamps and a $200 monthly stipend for living expenses from Children’s Aid, provided to foster children attending college. Children’s Aid also used $457 in Neediest Cases funds toward two months in rent arrears. In 2014 the organization used $1, 098 in Neediest Cases funds to cover rent and living expenses, as well as a MetroCard to travel to class. On a recent November day, walking along the college’s colorful indoor bridge that connects buildings across Lexington Avenue, Ms. Peoples, now 27, spoke animatedly about majoring in biology. Her bright   smile carried through a conversation about her darkest moments entering the foster care system and about the pride she felt celebrating her first graduation this summer. Dressed in a floral jacket and black leather boots and carting a snakeskin bag filled with schoolbooks and healthy snacks, she said she was working to take care of herself, both inside and out. “I wanted to better understand and monitor my diabetes,” Ms. Peoples said about deciding on her major. “Not just to go to the doctor to get information but to know how the food I eat interacts with my body. ” She recently became a member at a gym, has started taking Zumba and yoga classes at school and is rollerblading at a park in her Bronx neighborhood. She also cooks most of her food  —   baked chicken is a frequent meal  —   and incorporates whole wheat into her diet. Because of her lifestyle changes, she is now off all diabetes medication and can maintain normal blood sugar levels with diet and exercise. She has lost more than 50 pounds in the last six months. Now she would like to help others in impoverished communities make healthy dietary decisions, she said. She is pursuing a career in social work. Specifically, after seeing the effects of poverty in the Bronx, she has turned her attention to the plight of the homeless. “Having a support system through hardship is so important,” she said. “And oftentimes the homeless don’t have that. The situation of the homeless lays heavy on my heart. That’s where I see my chance to help others. ”",0
24785, The Los Angeles Times Endorses Hillary Clinton Ahead Of California Primary,"As Politico reports an almost neck-and-neck race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the Los Angeles Times has endorsed the former Secretary of State before the critical primary on June 7.The editorial board laid out plainly their support for Clinton, highlighting her ability to get the job done in the face of rising populism:As all the world knows, Clinton would be the first woman elected president of the United States. That would be a joyous, long-awaited, landmark moment in American history after centuries of discrimination and second-class status for half the population. But the real reason to support her is that she is the Democratic candidate most likely to get the job done.As the mainstream media is peddling a completely false narrative that Clinton s support is unexcited or unenthusiastic, the Los Angeles Times destroys that now hackneyed talking point:[C]linton s candidacy might seem unexciting. But nominating a candidate for president is, or ought to be, serious business. As Obama himself likely would admit after almost eight years in the White House, there is more to being president than grand promises, whether they are about  hope and change  or a political revolution. We admire Bernie Sanders  passion for progress and equality, but our endorsement goes to the candidate who is more likely to translate ideals into action.Sanders and Clinton have been fighting hard to win over the California electorate, which offers up just under 550 delegates. Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton a 97 percent chance of winning the state, but Sanders has shown to be as competitive as ever.The Times pointed out that Sanders  popular rhetoric amongst younger voters have made him a very formidable candidate who should be taken seriously, not brushed aside even heading into the convention (assuming Clinton clinches the magic number of delegates to win). Saying that he has made the race more substantive and he has drawn Clinton to he left, the board seriously doubted his ability to bring Republicans to the table.But that s not to say he couldn t.On the last day of registration, over 150,000 new citizens were admitted on the rolls, 42 percent of which were between the ages of 18 and 34, a good sign for Senator Sanders. Sanders also has outspent Clinton in critical metropolitan areas all across the state, including Los Angeles, Anaheim, San Diego and so forth.As the primary winds down, California will be the seemingly final hurrah in a long battle between the two progressive candidates, with one victor walking away as the nominee for president come July.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",1
11145,Australia defends hardline immigration policy as keeping out 'undesirables',"(Reuters) - Australia said on Sunday it is stopping  undesirables  such as terrorists, pedophiles, organized criminals and drug smugglers from boarding flights to the country, defending its hardline immigration policy that has drawn criticism from rights groups.  Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said that Australian Border Force Airline Liaison Officers were operating in major transit airports to push those threats  beyond our borders .  Where other countries  allow people to arrive and then assess the threat then , the  Australian model  was to bar those considered a threat.   (Liaison officers) try to identify the threats   particularly given that we ve got foreign fighters coming back through Southeast Asia and all over   the idea is to stop them getting on planes,  the minister told the Nine Network.  According to media, immigration officials prevented 1,043 passengers from boarding flights to Australia since 2013. Australia has seen the rise of nationalist, anti-immigration politics with far-right wing parties such as One Nation garnering strong public support, while the popularity of the ruling center-right government has been languishing. Under its policy on asylum seekers arriving by boat, Australia turns back unauthorized vessels at sea to their port of origin when it can and sends those it cannot to controversial camps in the South Pacific for long-term detention. Earlier this year, the government announced it would raise the bar for handing out citizenships by lengthening the waiting period, adding a new  Australian values  test and raising the standard for English language as part of a shake up of its immigration program.

28583,"US economy added 223,000 jobs in April","Really the only unusual or exciting thing about this jobs report is how unusual it is for something so thoroughly expected and non-game-changing to happen. Adding a bit over 200,000 jobs a month is both what analysts thought would happen, and also a trajectory that is consistent with a continued slow decline in unemployment but no real labor market boom.

Dive deeper into the data, and the basic lack of surprises only continues. Labor force participation is up, but only very slightly. Hourly wages are up, but only very slightly.

There's nothing about this jobs report that is likely to change the Federal Reserve's mind about anything, and therefore no reason to expect financial markets to have any particular reaction. Those who think the Fed's current course is dangerously inflationary will keep thinking that. Those who (more correctly!) think the Fed's current course is unreasonably inflation-averse will keep thinking that, as well. Janet Yellen will keep thinking she's on the right track.

Wage growth appears to have settled into a steady pattern that is somewhat better than what we saw at the depths of the recession, but far below what was considered normal before the recession. Partially offsetting this, overall consumer price inflation has been abnormally low for a couple of years now. There are also some compositional effects pulling average wages down as a large cohort of inexperienced 20-somethings have been entering the workforce.

Overall it is a little difficult to understand why some of the small upward bumps have been interpreted in some quarters as a sign of an imminent inflationary breakout. Even the strongest wage-growth months have been weak compared with 2006 or 2007, years that were not exactly halcyon days for the American worker.

Perhaps the clearest sign of how not-yet-completed America's recovery comes from looking at the level of full-time jobs, which is still well below where it was in 2007:

The population, needless to say, has grown in the intervening years, meaning that the failure to fully catch up in job growth makes it difficult for rank-and-file workers to gain bargaining leverage.",0

“Clinton’s platform on racial justice is strong: It is informed by the policy failings of the past and is a vision for where we need to go,” McKesson wrote in a Washington Post op-ed . Clinton hosted a meeting with McKesson and other Black Lives Matter activists in the fall to discuss the Campaign Zero plan to end police violence. McKesson wrote that Clinton “didn’t appear to understand the urgency of the need to address racism” when she began running for the White House but that her position on racial justice is now “strong.”",1
18172, It’s Not Over: Trump’s Tantrums Drive Senate GOP To Take Aim Yet Again At Healthcare,"Trumpcare failed in the most hilarious and dramatic middle-of-the-night vote on the Senate floor   they couldn t even pass a  skinny repeal  after seven years of promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And, of course, the Toddler-in-Chief, getting ever-more desperate to actually start  winning,  threw a livid fit on Twitter about it.And some Republicans look like they re starting to let his Twitter tantrums dictate their behavior. They can t even understand the words  give up,  it seems, despite the fact that McConnell and others in the GOP leadership have said it s time to move on to other things. Lindsey Graham already has a new proposal that would give block grants to states for things like Medicaid, and keep most of the existing tax structure from the ACA.Trump s White House also went crawling to Rep. Mark Meadows over in the House to see how they could get more conservatives on board with, well, pretty much anything. All of this happened not too long after Trump went after Republicans for being the utter failures they are. He wants them to switch to a 51-vote threshold so 8 Democrats can t control the country (in his words), and he threatened to end payments to insurance companies and yank Congress  healthcare plans (which they get through the ACA s exchanges):If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017Trump has even repeatedly asked McConnell to change Senate rules to make it so that they only need 51 votes to pass anything. The thing that Trump isn t getting is that every Trumpcare bill that s failed in the Senate thus far has done so because it failed to even reach 50 votes. Plus McConnell won t change the rules anyway.Maybe if Republicans would actually work with Democrats, who have said they re open and willing to work on a bipartisan plan to fix problems in the ACA, we wouldn t be having this problem.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",1
31812, Trump Threatens To File Battery Charges On Reporter His Campaign Manager Assaulted (VIDEO),"Donald Trump spent Wednesday morning trying to convince the American media that his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, is a really good guy who is being railroaded by some crazy woman. During one of his interviews with Good Morning America, though, he took it a step further and threatened to file charges on Michelle Fields, the reporter Lewandowski is charged with assaulting, because she  touched  Trump s arm.The hosts asked Trump if it was clear to him, after watching the video, that his campaign manager did touch Fields, even though he has insisted that he didn t. Trump responded: Well, what s clear is that she was touching me and she broke through the Secret Service. And she was asking me questions when there were no questions we were leaving, the press conference was over. She broke through, she grabbed my arm, I think a couple of times. You see me trying to get her hand off my arm and he saw something and did very minor..Her face wasn t that of a woman screaming in pain He didn t try to throw her to the ground. You look at Twitter, people think it s a total disgrace she s filing charges. I would just like to point out that this is typical abuser behavior. Instead of Trump admitting that his campaign manager was wrong and he should have kept his hands off of this woman, he is trying to place the blame squarely on her shoulders. It s like when an abusive husband punches his wife in the face, then he and his buddies say, Well, you shouldn t have mouthed off. After the long rant about how Fields was to blame for Lewandowski s actions, Trump said: I m sure there will be a counter-claim coming down the line. Should I file charges against her because she touched my arm as well? His campaign manager did NOT just  touch her arm.  He grabbed her so hard that she was left with bruises, that is not  minor,  it is battery and that s why he was charged with a crime. Clearly the police believed that he assaulted this reporter and it is disgusting the Trump is defending him. However, this is what we have come to expect from the Republican frontrunner. He and his campaign have zero respect for anybody, especially not women.Watch the interview:https://www.facebook.com/GoodMorningAmerica/videos/vb.59306617060/10153518346397061/?type=2&theaterFeatured image via video screenshot",1
60085,Obama shortens prison sentences for 98 convicts: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama shortened the prison sentences for 98 convicts serving time for drug-related offenses in his latest round of commutations, including for 42 people serving life sentences, the White House said on Thursday. Obama has granted 688 commutations this year, for a total so far of 872 during his presidency, which ends on Jan. 20. “These are individuals - many of whom made mistakes at a young age - who have diligently worked to rehabilitate themselves while incarcerated,” White House Counsel Neil Eggleston said in a statement. The commutations are part of Obama’s push to reform the criminal justice system to reduce the number of people serving long sentences for non-violent drug offenses. Obama and a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the U.S. Congress had tried to work on legislation to reduce mandatory minimum sentences, but those efforts stalled ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.

57844, Justice Dept. Has Had Enough — Sues Ferguson Over Police Misconduct,"The Department of Justice laid down the law on Wednesday and announced that they have had enough and they are suing Ferguson for police misconduct. The decision to sue came after the Ferguson City Council voted on Tuesday to change the terms of a deal that had been negotiated over seven months.The DOJ began investigating Ferguson police after 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by former police officer Darren Wilson. Although Wilson was cleared of any wrongdoing, federal authorities found a pattern of abuse and systematic racism within the department.For seven months federal authorities and the city hashed out a deal to fix the problems within the police department. In a tentative agreement the city agreed to hire consultants to train officials, require every officer to have a dash or body cam, abide by specific guidelines for when officers can stop and question people on the streets, along with a number of other things. On Tuesday, though, the city suddenly decided that they wanted to alter the agreement. Shortly after the vote, the feds released a statement: The Ferguson City Council has attempted to unilaterally amend the negotiated agreement,  Vanita Gupta, head of the agency s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement.  Their vote to do so creates an unnecessary delay in the essential work to bring constitutional policing to the city, and marks an unfortunate outcome for concerned community members and Ferguson police officers. On Wednesday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch dropped the lawsuit on the brilliant city council. She told reporters, We intend to aggressively prosecute this case and we intend to prevail.  She continued: The residents of Ferguson have suffered the deprivation of their constitutional rights, the rights guaranteed to all Americans, for decades. They have waited decades for justice. They should not be forced to wait any longer These violations were not only egregious, they were routine. They were encouraged by the city in the interest of raising revenue. They were driven, at least in part, by racial bias and they occurred disproportionately against African-American residents of Ferguson. The fact is, the city has failed the people of Ferguson on so many levels and now they are going to waste millions of dollars trying to fight the federal government because THEY tried to play fast and loose with the DOJ. They knew that their actions on Tuesday would result in litigation, but they took it as seriously as they take protecting people in their city.Hopefully, the citizens of Ferguson are able to get rid of each and every one of the council members who played a role in this vote.

His tenure was marked by the Edward Snowden leaks on US intelligence. He s always said he d resign at the end of Obama s presidency but we re wondering if he s jumping before Trump appointees arrive. Clapper and Gen. Mike Flynn have a history that s not so perfect:Two years ago, I was called into a meeting with the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and the director of national intelligence, and after some  niceties,  I was told by the USDI that I was being let go from DIA. It was definitely an uncomfortable moment (I suspect more for them than me).I asked the DNI (Gen. James Clapper) if my leadership of the agency was in question and he said it was not; had it been, he said, they would have relieved me on the spot.I knew then it had more to do with the stand I took on radical Islamism and the expansion of al Qaeda and its associated movements. I felt the intel system was way too politicized, especially in the Defense Department. After being fired, I left the meeting thinking,  Here we are in the middle of a war, I had a significant amount of combat experience (nearly five years) against this determined enemy on the battlefield and served at senior levels, and here it was, the bureaucracy was letting me go.

14294,U.S. judge to mull release of Trump video testimony,"SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel said on Wednesday he would take more time to decide whether video excerpts of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump answering questions under oath about his Trump University seminars should be made public. Curiel is overseeing two class-action lawsuits in San Diego over the real estate seminar venture. A separate fraud case by New York state’s attorney general is pending. Trump has suggested Curiel is biased against him because of his campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration. Curiel was born in Indiana but is of Mexican descent.  On Wednesday, Trump’s lawyers fought release of the videos, arguing that they would be exploited during the presidential campaign. “There’s all kinds of potential for mischief,” Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for Trump, told Curiel.  Jason Forge, a lawyer for the students who claim they were misled and defrauded by Trump University, said Petrocelli could not point to any particular harm if the videos are released since transcripts are already public. The lawsuits accuse Trump of bilking students who paid as much as $35,000 each to learn his real estate investment strategies. The students claim they learned little.

However, rather than act like it s some kind of new thing, he avoided the rhetoric and called it exactly what it is.It s just the latest link in a very long and unbroken chain of choices made by Republicans to disrespect, delegitimize, and smear the legacy of the first black President of the United States.

16461,"Russia to donate Kalashnikovs, trucks and munitions to Philippines","MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday announced that Russia would donate defense hardware to support the military s fight against pro-Islamic State militants, who he said could regroup and attack  anywhere and everywhere . Duterte said Russia would provide about 5,000 assault rifles in a deal to be signed this month, and the Philippine military would no longer have to use second-hand arms.  We will have the Kalashnikov,  he said in a speech to troops, adding that Russia wanted to keep the donation secret. Moscow s gift would follow China s donation of more than 6,000 assault rifles and 100 sniper rifles, among the fruits of Duterte s efforts to form partnerships with two arms-producing powers that are rivals to the United States. The United States has for decades been the Philippines  defense treaty ally and its biggest source or hardware and training, providing about $1 billion in equipment since 2000. Duterte has made no secret of his animosity toward Washington and his disdain for the U.S. military alliance. A senior defense official told Reuters the Russian weapons would arrive later this month, when Russia s defense minister attends a regional meeting. The rifles would be accompanied by millions of rounds of ammunition and dozens of army trucks. Five Russian warships were due to visit in Manila to deliver the equipment, the official said. Four have visited the country this year, in two separate visits. Duterte said the military needed to be properly equipped to handle Islamic State loyalists who had established a dangerous foothold in Mindanao in the south.  They will not disappear, they will regroup anywhere and everywhere,  Duterte said.     ",0
4463,"Patti LuPone, Christine Ebersole and Broadway’s Friendliest Feud - The New York Times","“You’ve got lovely beds. Good beds,” the actress Patti LuPone said. She was referring not to furniture, but fingernails: the unvarnished ones on the hands of her current   Christine Ebersole. They contrasted markedly with Ms. LuPone’s nails, which she herself had lacquered in shiny maroon, after years observing professional manicurists. “I watch how they depress the fluid,” Ms. LuPone said, pantomiming bottle and brush. “The problem is, when I put nail polish on it really weakens my nails,” Ms. Ebersole said in a sisterly way. “They just flake off. ” The talons were out, in other words, but this was not a catfight. More a chat ’n’ chew between Tony   actresses getting the chance to share a Broadway stage for the first time in “War Paint,” one of a   new musicals debuting in a mad cram before the season ends. Dressed in a confusion of stretchy black clothing and scarves, the two women were sharing a sofa in the upper half of a sleek duplex at 663 Fifth Avenue, where the flagship of Elizabeth Arden’s signature spa, the Red Door, moved five years ago from the florid former Aeolian Building two blocks north. They had refused treatments and were instead efficiently slurping vegetarian soups. In “War Paint,” which is now in previews and opens at the Nederlander Theater on April 6, Ms. Ebersole, 64, plays Miss Arden, née Florence Nightingale Graham: the entrepreneur who made cosmetics, long associated with prostitutes, acceptable and desirable to the American middle and upper classes starting in the 1910s. Ms. LuPone, 67, plays Arden’s   but equally esteemed competitor, Helena Rubinstein, who imparted both artistic and clinical prestige to the pursuit of beauty, and who is credited with the phrase “there are no ugly women, only lazy ones. ” Bette Davis vs. Joan Crawford Alexis Colby vs. Krystle Carrington: Female rivalries have long meant boffo box office and Nielsen ratings points. But theatergoers hoping for Ms. Ebersole and Ms. LuPone to whack each other with pocketbooks or hurl drinks like Anne Bancroft and Shirley MacLaine in “The Turning Point” are due for disappointment. Rather, their characters fight by issuing new products, raiding staff and investing in premium real estate: penthouses and country spreads for Rubinstein, who donated millions of dollars to arts education and other causes through her foundation an Irish castle and Lexington, Ky. breeding stable for Arden, who was passionately devoted to horses and marched with suffragists. “We should really look at them as role models,” Ms. LuPone said of the two tycoons. “They were really inspiring,” Ms. Ebersole said. “My God,” Ms LuPone said. “Regardless of what their personal flaws were, or what drove them  —   nothing that they achieved for themselves and then in the name of woman has ever been matched!” Ms. Ebersole, more gently: “They paved the way, and started before women had the vote. ” Ms. LuPone was incensed by news reports about the departing C. E. O. of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer. “Her male replacement is getting twice as much as she is,” she said. “Twice as much!” The gender pay inequity common in the film industry is not an issue for “War Paint,” which is capitalized at $11 million and carried by its leading ladies, one or both of whom appear in all but four of the show’s numbers. But the fact that its principal creators are all men might arch an eyebrow. The musical takes its title and basic premise from a dual biography by Lindy Woodhead published in 2004 that a few years later inspired a documentary, “The Powder  the Glory,” to which David Stone, a producer, was introduced by the director James Lapine. Mr. Stone has had tremendous success with “Wicked,” another musical centered on female foes, and, among other projects, worked on “The Vagina Monologues” by Eve Ensler. He called her for advice before proceeding. “Eve said, ‘This can’t be about makeup.’ And it’s not,” Mr. Stone said. “It’s about women and beauty and power and how women treat each other. ” Mr. Stone and Ms. LuPone both wrinkle their noses at the word “diva,” a description cribbed from Italian opera that is now often applied to any commanding female presence in the entertainment industry, inevitably also suggesting an excess of temperament. “I just can’t stand it,” Mr. Stone said. “Diva implies difficult. ” At a talk about the show a few months ago, Ms. LuPone proposed “dame” as an alternative, to approving whoops from the audience. After securing rights to the material, Mr. Stone hired Michael Greif, with whom he had worked on “Next to Normal” and “” to direct. They brought in the composer Scott Frankel, the lyricist Michael Korie and the book writer Doug Wright, Mr. Greif’s collaborators on the musical “Grey Gardens,” inspired by the Maysles brothers’ cult documentary about the eccentric aristocrats “Big Edie” Beale and her daughter, “Little Edie. ” Some early workshops of “War Paint” featured Donna Murphy in the Arden role but she withdrew for family reasons, and Ms. Ebersole, who had won a 2007 Tony for portraying both Beales at different stages of their lives, assumed the part. She and Ms. LuPone, for whom this is the first musical since the   “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown” (2010) were not shy about participating in the creative process. “Both of them were very excited to play against the obvious  —   feuding,    stars and that kind of energy  —   and actually find ways where the competition between them was nourishing,” Mr. Frankel said a few hours before curtain on a recent evening. “These women were enormously sophisticated and tasteful and   in corporate weaponry,” Mr. Wright said. “They didn’t have to reduce things to an insult they could actually wage business warfare against one another and did so very effectively for 50 years. ” Anything “that felt cheap or easy,” he said, the actresses “instantly rejected. ” Criticism of an    tryout in Chicago last summer focused on relentless   between its two subjects, who supposedly never met in real life. About a third of the show has been revised, the creators said, both to fortify the solo appearances and to find novel ways of bringing the characters together onstage. “There was some tightening,” Mr. Frankel said, slipping into   patois. “Because it’s the two of them, there’s a little bit of inherent    that’s intrinsic in the proposition of the evening, but I think we tried to find ways to mix that up in more unexpected ways. ” He and his colleagues were adamant that “War Paint” is not purely ladies’ entertainment, though the Broadway audience is disproportionately female, a demographic that has helped make shows like “Waitress” into hits. “There are metaphors inherent in the idea of makeup that I think transcend gender,” Mr. Wright said. “It offers a potential mask where you can pretend to be someone you aren’t it offers a disguise if you don’t wish to be recognized it offers an avenue toward a certain kind of perceived   it is a kind of lure to attract someone else. ” But with its   costume changes designed by Catherine Zuber, including   hats and piles of glittering jewelry, and makeup by Angelina Avallone, “War Paint” has been an occasion for the two stars to reflect on how cosmetics and other trappings have been integral to their long careers. “Once I put on the wig it’s like ‘O. K. badda bing, badda boom,’” Ms. LuPone said. “I’m not the type of actress that goes into a corner and meditates for 20 minutes on the bones of Helena Rubinstein. Do you know what I mean?” Ms. Ebersole said that for performers backstage as well as for many people in real life, “putting on makeup is a really great centering device. It’s a way of having you focus on what you’re doing. As you put on the mask, then the other things come through. ” She recalled her work in the 2001 revival of “42nd Street,” for which she won her first Tony with the help of 1930s regalia by Roger Kirk: “The costumes just informed everything. ” This inspired Ms. LuPone to reminisce about “Evita,” for which she got her first Tony, at 31. “The amount of  —   for lack of a better word  —   gack that we’re putting on!” she said. “I also harken back to that time in ‘Anything Goes’ when I was in those   gowns. Oy, I can’t wear a   gown now to save my life, unless I’m strapped in. ” The two actresses were “babies in the city together,” as Ms. LuPone put it. She arrived in 1968 to attend Juilliard, where she studied with Marian Seldes, having known she wanted to perform since she was 4, standing downstage right in a tap recital. Ms. Ebersole, who had gone to MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Ill. before enrolling at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1973, had had other plans. “I was going to be a nurse,” she said. “Of course you were,” Ms. LuPone said. “Look at her!” Instead Ms. Ebersole served customers at the Lion’s Rock, a restaurant on the Upper East Side with water splashing down a   slab of red granite. “It’s condominiums now, I think,” she said. Ms. LuPone, meanwhile, worked at a “wannabe mobster” hangout run by a man who imported cages for dancing girls in nightclubs. “My roommate was one of the dancers, and I wasn’t pretty enough, tall enough or thin enough to be a dancer, so I was a waitress in a   lace ” she said. Both women bemoaned a lost era when actors (and stagehands) were recognized and welcomed in the theater district at places like Jimmy Ray’s and Charlie O. ’s, and spent time after the show socializing rather than cultivating followings on Twitter and YouTube. “I think we have fewer showmen,” Ms. LuPone said. “Like the Irving Thalbergs and the Alex Cohens and the Robert Whiteheads and the people that loved the theater or loved making movies. It’s such a cliché, but it’s all bean counters. It’s statistics. Polling. ” This was a reminder that the unexpected foil in the   showdown was Charles Revson, the founder of Revlon, rendered in “War Paint” by Erik Liberman as “a   carnival barker in an Italian suit. ” It’s a line that for some involved with the production took on new resonance after Donald J. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. Overnight, in their view, the musical went from celebration to cautionary tale. After Rubinstein died in 1965, Revson bought her Park Avenue triplex. But that wasn’t the final indignity. Last year, the company he founded, which had brought sex back into the midcentury cosmetics marketplace with suggestive ad copy and flashy layouts, took over Elizabeth Arden. “Everybody’s rolling over in their grave!” Ms. LuPone said. Not that any of these brands make her particularly nostalgic. “I used to be a Georgette Klinger girl. For years,” she said, after the two women packed up a gift of exfoliating face pads and descended nine floors to the lobby. “Oh my gosh, Georgette Klinger, I completely forgot that name,” Ms. Ebersole said, blinking her blue eyes on the sunny sidewalk. “That was a salon,” Ms. LuPone said. “You’d go in, and close the door, and they were all about getting into your face. They don’t get into your face anymore. ”",0

39939,"O’Keefe: Dems, Left, and Media Should Be Asked If They Disavow Violent Inauguration Protesters","James O’Keefe joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM hosts Alex Marlow and Raheem Kassam on Wednesday to discuss Project Veritas’ latest undercover video investigation that revealed protesters’ plans to disrupt the inauguration of   Donald Trump. [As Breitbart News reported:   James O’Keefe and Project Veritas released a new undercover video on Tuesday showing   activists with the “DisruptJ20” effort plotting to stop Donald Trump’s inauguration by chaining D. C. Metro trains and blocking roads. The video adds a layer of deep detail to a story by Ryan Lovelace in the Washington Examiner earlier this month, “How protesters plan to wreck Donald Trump’s inauguration,” which first reported the efforts of “#DisruptJ20. ” One activist leader is captured on the Project Veritas video saying: “So simultaneous to the checkpoint blockades in the morning, we are also doing a series of clusterfuck blockades, where we are going to try to blockade all the major ingress points into the city. ” As far as others on the Left disavowing the alleged plan, said O’Keefe, “We embedded this video compilation of the best terrorism bits, and we tagged Michael Moore,” along with Van Jones, George Soros’ deputies, Mark Ruffalo, and others. There was no indication that any of them disavowed any of it. The panel went on to discuss the media’s refusal to hold the Left accountable by calling on them to denounce these groups, as they are quick to do with the Right.
