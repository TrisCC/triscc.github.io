34240,HOW HILLARY Reminded Us Last Week That We’re So Lucky She Wasn’t Elected,"Clinton sent out a taunting tweet of  3-0  after the three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously slapped a halt on Trump s executive order on immigrants and  refugees.Trump tweeted out  SEE YOU IN COURT Hillary responded with a snarky  3-0 Her support for the ruling isn t surprising   Clinton said she was for open borders at one point   but the gutter sniping was telling. The activist judges who based their ruling on their liberal politics instead of the Constitution are the same kind she would appoint to the Supreme Court and all other federal courts if she were in the Oval Office.Thankfully, she won t get the chance, a fact reinforced by Trump aide Kellyanne Conway. She fired back at Clinton with her version of  3-0,  tweeting  PA, WI, MI,  a reference to three formerly blue states, worth 46 electoral votes, that Trump flipped to his column. Touch !And so it went in Week 3 of the Trump era, with Clinton s taunt, the court ruling, nonstop demonstrations and congressional hijinks combining to illustrate why Trump s election was crucial. It was a necessary course correction and a dramatic rejection of an arrogant government that both overreaches and underperforms.Put another way, the hysterical, hateful reaction in many quarters to everything Trump says and does is absolute proof that the ruling elite deserved a comeuppance. The establishment was drunk on power, political and cultural, and never yielded an inch voluntarily or had the decency to admit error. Its rage reflects its sense of entitlement. This unhinged rage is the new America   only it s not new. It was hiding in plain sight, hinted at by the contempt that Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, tenured radicals, college snowflakes and the Democratic media openly held for those who don t share their worldview.Trump s victory ripped open the vein, but it would have erupted at any Republican president. Modern liberals  contempt for others is essential to their sense of superiority and justifies violence in the streets, threats and simple rudeness Read more: NYP",1
49191, Heidi Cruz Seems POSITIVE Her Husband Is The Second Coming Of Christ (AUDIO),"When thinking about the qualities of someone who should be president, it should be someone who embraces the founding principles as mentioned in our founding documents. Someone who respects freedom of speech, freedom of and from religion, equality under the law, and so on.When thinking about the qualities of Senator Ted Cruz, he doesn t seem to embody much, if any, of those founding principles as they are written. However, he does embody the principles he imagines in his head of what the founders actually meant. He thinks the nation was founded on  Judeo-Christian  principles, and sure, while some of the founders were Christian, many were Deist and didn t believe in the deification of Jesus as mentioned in the Christian Bible.However, Cruz, and several of those who seem to believe what they will about the Constitution and our founders, will continue to wrongfully tout the line that we re a Christian nation. One of those individuals being the Texas senator s wife.While speaking to South Carolina radio host Vince Coakley, Heidi Cruz first told us all the qualities that embody her husband: a man of faith, a believer, a constitutionalist, defender of values, and doesn t waver from his beliefs. However, then she goes on and says something that one can only assume is her declaring Ted Cruz as the second coming of Christ. She said: When I thought about doing it for our country, it became very clear to me that our family must be in this race. And it also became clear to me that we are at a cultural crossroads in our country and if we can be in this race to show this country the face of the God that we serve   this Christian God that we serve is the foundation of our country, our country was built on Judeo-Christian values, we are a nation of freedom of religion, but the God of Christianity is the God of freedom, of individual liberty, of choice and of consequence.And I think that s something that this country really needs to be reminded of, is that Christians are loving people, are nonjudgmental people, but there is right and wrong, we have a country of law and order, there are consequences to actions and we must all live peaceably in our own faiths under the Constitution. And Ted is uniquely able to deliver on that combination of the law and religion. Ted Cruz is going to show us the  face of God ?? What the heck kind of language is that? And if we don t elect her husband, we re going against God? How about this, let s not use any God as a political prop to garner votes in a flailing campaign. Which is exactly what the Cruz family seems to be doing.Oh, and if we re to live in a nation that respects  freedom of religion  that s all religions or lack there of. However, that freedom does not allow any religion to legislate by its religious principles. So while many are terrified of Sharia Law, which is not allowed, neither is Christian Law. Freedom of religion is the freedom to worship whatever you want on your own time as long as you re not harming others. Now, if someone comes into your place of worship and tells you that you can t worship your God, well then that would actually be a violation of your freedom. However, that s not happening, so all this  religious freedom  malarkey is being drummed up to rile up a base of voters that don t know any better. And if she thinks her husband is  nonjudgmental  she must not be listening to the same guy we ve all been subject to hearing for far too long now.No, Heidi, your husband won t show us the  face of God    he s not the second coming of Christ, and he wasn t sent to this earth my means of Canada to govern the United States by  Judeo-Christian  principles. You are mistaken.Listen here to Heidi Cruz go on and on about her husband:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246382976  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Featured image: Flickr/Wikimedia",1

66913,USA TODAY Caught Fabricating Story About Innocent “Dreamer” Being Deported…Here’s The Truth [VIDEO],"More fake news pushing a leftist agenda If you read the USA Today report of Juan Manuel Montes being deported you might believe their headline:  First Protected Dreamer Deported Under Trump USA Today reported Tuesday that an illegal immigrant protected by Barack Obama s amnesty was deported in February after spending an evening with his girlfriend. However, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman told The Daily Caller that this story is false because Juan Manuel Montes Bojorquez did not receive amnesty and was caught climbing over a border fence when he was detained.  Conservative TreehouseThe USA Today story said that Bojorquez, 23, was apprehended by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents while he was waiting for a car ride to pick him up.According to the article, he told the officers he left his wallet in his friend s car and, because he didn t have his ID or proof of his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, he was deported. Within three hours, he was back in Mexico, becoming the first undocumented immigrant with active DACA status deported by the Trump administration s stepped-up deportation policy,  the USA Today reporters wrote.The Trump administration has said it will continue honoring the over 750,000 illegal immigrants who receive DACA, but this incident, if accurate, would have been a departure from that policy. David Lapan, a DHS spokesman, told TheDC,  Juan Manuel Montes Bojorquez was apprehended by the Calexico Station Border Patrol after illegally entering the U.S. by climbing over the fence in downtown Calexico. He was arrested by BP just minutes after he made his illegal entry and admitted under oath during the arrest interview that he had entered illegally. The spokesman added,  His DACA status expired in Aug. 2015 and he was notified at that time. In addition, he has a conviction for theft for which he received probation.  Daily CallerFrom USA Today: Federal agents ignored President Trump s pledge to protect from deportation undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children by sending a young man back to his native Mexico, the first such documented case, a USA TODAY examination of the new administration s immigration policies shows.After spending an evening with his girlfriend in Calexico, Calif., on Feb. 17, Juan Manuel Montes, 23, who has lived in the U.S. since age 9, grabbed a bite and was waiting for a ride when a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer approached and started asking questions.Montes was twice granted deportation protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program created by President Barack Obama and left intact by President Trump.Montes had left his wallet in a friend s car, so he couldn t produce his ID or proof of his DACA status and was told by agents he couldn t retrieve them. Within three hours, he was back in Mexico, becoming the first undocumented immigrant with active DACA status deported by the Trump administration s stepped-up deportation policy. Some people told me that they were going to deport me; others said nothing would happen,  Montes told USA TODAY in his aunt and uncle s home in western Mexico where he s been staying.  I thought that if I kept my nose clean nothing would happen.  He asked that the exact location of their home be withheld.Yet Trump declined to revoke the DACA protections Obama had granted to more than 750,000 undocumented immigrants, repeatedly saying he had a soft spot for these young people who are leading productive lives and have few, if any, ties to the countries of their birth. They shouldn t be very worried,  he told ABC News in January.  I do have a big heart. Even so, DACA enrollees are being targeted by immigration authorities.At least 10 are in federal custody, according to United We Dream, an advocacy organization made up of DACA enrollees and other young immigrants.The group s advocacy director, Greisa Martinez, who has DACA protection, said Montes  case is proof that people like herself are at risk despite what Trump said.For entire story: USA Today ",1
35483,LOL! CHUCKIE SCHUMER WARNS TRUMP Is “In Trouble” For Accusing Obama Of Wiretapping Trump Towers…What Schumer Says Next Is HILARIOUS!,"The top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer (NY), claimed Sunday that President Trump is  in trouble,  a stern warning that came a day after the commander-in-tweet claimed President Obama wiretapped him.Citing President Obama s denial that he ordered a wiretap of Trump, Schumer said,  Either way   the president s in trouble. If he falsely spread this kind of misinformation, that is so wrong. It s beneath the dignity of the presidency. It is something that really hurts people s view of government,  he said.Yeah, because making the embarrassing, race-baiter-for-hire Al Sharpton a regular visitor at the White House is somehow not beneath the dignity of the presidency? You mean like taking  selfies  during the funeral of one of the greatest civil rights leaders in the world? Or traveling to Cuba to hang out at a baseball game with Raul Castro, who along with his brother are some of the most brutal dictators in the world?Were Watergate reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein shamed for making  government look bad  when they uncovered the wire-tapping done by President Nixon? He deserved it? Really Chuck? Because he was running against Hillary Clinton or because he was simply on the wrong team? If he were a Democrat, would have have deserved it? On the other hand, if it s true, it s even worse for the president.

28288, Trump Hints He Will Continue To Be An Absolute Diplomatic Nightmare With China (DETAILS),"One of the first things Donald Trump did after winning the presidential election was to completely crush decades of diplomatic policy with China, by accepting a phone call from the president of Taiwan. At first, it seemed that China would let Trump s blunder go and chalk it up to his political inexperience. However, when Trump doubled down on his antics, China decided to fly a bomber into the South China Sea in a show of force against Trump, in order to let him know that the United States had better keep the  One China  policy   or else.After this snafu, Ned Price, speaking for the Obama White House s National Security Council, said: There is no change to our longstanding policy on cross-Strait issues. Our fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable cross-Strait relations. Well, now, it seems that Trump is going in that direction again, and is even entertaining the idea of taking a meeting with the Taiwanese president. When reporters asked him about his plans for diplomatic relations in that direction and whether he d meet the President of Taiwan, Trump said,  we ll see. He insists, however, that the United States will not have a rocky relationship with China under a Trump administration: Hopefully we re going to have great relationships with many countries   and that includes China. Well, I got news for you, Donald Trump. If you keep flirting with recognizing Taiwan, things with China are gonna go south really, really fast. Diplomacy is important, as you will soon learn. Some of these international relationships are tenuous at best, and one wrong move could cause the whole thing to come crashing down like a house of cards built on the softest bed of sand imaginable. Now that you are the president-elect, your words have consequences. Don t go bandying about nuclear weapons and undoing years upon years of diplomatic norms. We ll ALL suffer the consequences if you do.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",1

14162,Jimmy Carter: ‘Koreans Want Peace Treaty to Replace 1953 Ceasefire’,"21st Century Wire says Reframing the current diplomatic crisis in North Korea is essential if genuine progress is to be made in diffusing the current tense situation.Former US President Jimmy Carter is suggesting just that. But will the hawks in Washington listen?. The Carter CenterThe harsh rhetoric from Washington and Pyongyang during recent months has exacerbated an already confrontational relationship between our countries, and has probably eliminated any chance of good faith peace talks between the United States and North Korea. In addition to restraining the warlike rhetoric, our leaders need to encourage talks between North Korea and other countries, especially China and Russia. The recent UN Security Council unanimous vote for new sanctions suggests that these countries could help.  In all cases, a nuclear exchange must be avoided. All parties must assure North Koreans they we will forego any military action against them if North Korea remains peaceful.President Jimmy CarterI have visited North Korea three times, and have spent more than 20 hours in discussions with their political leaders regarding important issues that affect U.S.-DPRK relations.In June 1994, I met with Kim Il Sung in a time of crisis, when he agreed to put all their nuclear programs under strict supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency and to seek mutual agreement with the United States on a permanent peace treaty, to have summit talks with the president of South Korea, to expedite the recovery of the remains of American service personnel buried in his country, and to take other steps to ease tension on the peninsula. Kim Il Sung died shortly after my visit, and his successor, Kim Jong Il, notified me and leaders in Washington that he would honor the promises made by his father. These obligations were later confirmed officially in negotiations in Geneva by Robert Gallucci and other representatives of the Clinton administration.I returned to Pyongyang in August 2010, at the invitation of North Korean leaders, to bring home Aijalon Gomes, an American who had been detained there. My last visit to North Korea was in May 2011 when I led a delegation of Elders (former presidents of Ireland and Finland and former prime minister of Norway) to assure the delivery of donated food directly to needy people.During all these visits, the North Koreans emphasized that they wanted peaceful relations with the United States and their neighbors, but were convinced that we planned a preemptive military strike against their country. They wanted a peace treaty (especially with America) to replace the ceasefire agreement that had existed since the end of the Korean War in 1953, and to end the economic sanctions that had been very damaging to them during that long interim period. They have made it clear to me and others that their first priority is to assure that their military capability is capable of destroying a large part of Seoul and of responding strongly in other ways to any American attack. The influence of China in Pyongyang seems to be greatly reduced since Kim Jong Un became the North Korean leader in December 2011.A commitment to peace by the United States and North Korea is crucial.When this confrontational crisis is ended, the United States should be prepared to consummate a permanent treaty to replace the ceasefire of 1953. The United States should make this clear, to North Koreans and to our allies.READ MORE NORTH KOREA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire North Korea FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",1
41177,2006 Audio Emerges of Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election," 2006 Audio Emerges of Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election
Unearthed tape: 'We should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win'
By Ken Kurson
 "" Observer "" - On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.
The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.
The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clintons Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is rigged.
Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).
I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake, said Sen. Clinton. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.
Chomsky recalls being taken aback that anyone could support the ideaoffered by a national political leader, no lessthat the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.
Some eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency.
Regarding capturing combatants in warthe June capture of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas militants who came across the Gaza border via an underground tunnel was very much front of mindClinton can be heard on the tape saying, And then, when, you know, Hamas, you know, sent the terrorists, you know, through the tunnel into Israel that killed and captured, you know, kidnapped the young Israeli soldier, you know, theres a sense of like, one-upsmanship, and in these cultures of, you know, well, if they captured a soldier, weve got to capture a soldier.
Equating Hamas, which to this day remains on the State Departments official list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, with the armed forces of a close American ally was not what many expected to hear in the Jewish Press editorial offices, which were then at Third Avenue and Third Street in Brooklyn. (The papers office has since moved to the Boro Park section of Brooklyn.) The use of the phrase these cultures is also a bit of a head-scratcher.
According to Chomsky, Clinton was gracious, personable and pleasant throughout the interview, taking about an hour to speak to, in addition to himself, managing editor Jerry Greenwald, assistant to the publisher Naomi Klass Mauer, counsel Dennis Rapps and senior editor Jason Maoz.
Another part of the tape highlights something that was relatively uncontroversial at the time but has taken on new meaning in light of the current campaignspeaking to leaders with whom our country is not on the best terms. Clinton has presented a very tough front in discussing Russia, for example, accusing Trump of unseemly ardor for strongman Vladimir Putin and mocking his oft-stated prediction that as president hed get along with Putin.
Chomsky is heard on the tape asking Clinton what now seems like a prescient question about Syria, given the disaster unfolding there and its looming threat to drag the U.S., Iran and Russia into confrontation.
Do you think its worth talking to Syriaboth from the U.S. point [of view] and Israels point [of view]?
Clinton replied, You know, Im pretty much of the mind that I dont see what it hurts to talk to people. As long as youre not stupid and giving things away. I mean, we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years. They invaded Hungary, they invaded Czechoslovakia, they persecuted the Jews, they invaded Afghanistan, they destabilized governments, they put missiles 90 miles from our shores, we never stopped talking to them, an answer that reflects her mastery of the facts but also reflects a willingness to talk to Russia that sounds more like Trump 2016 than Clinton 2016.
Shortly after, she said, But if you say, theyre evil, were good, [and] were never dealing with them, I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them So I would like to talk to you [the enemy] because I want to know more about you. Because if I want to defeat you, Ive got to know something more about you. I need different tools to use in my campaign against you. Thats my take on it.
A final bit of interest to the current campaign involves an articulation of phrases that Trump has accused Clinton of being reluctant to use. Discussing the need for a response to terrorism, Clinton said, I think you can make the case that whether you call it Islamic terrorism or Islamo-fascism, whatever the label is were going to give to this phenomenon, its a threat. Its a global threat. To Europe, to Israel, to the United States Therefore we need a global response. Its a global threat and it needs a global response. That can be the, sort of, statement of principle So I think sometimes having the global vision is a help as long as you realize that underneath that global vision theres a lot of variety and differentiation that has to go on.
Its not clear what she means by a global vision with variety and differentiation, but whats quite clear is that the then-senator, just five years after her state was the epicenter of the September 11 attacks, was comfortable deploying the phrase Islamic terrorism and the even more strident Islamo-fascism, at least when meeting with the editorial board of a Jewish newspaper.
In an interview before the Observer heard the tape, Chomsky told the Observer that Clinton made some odd and controversial comments on the tape. The irony of a decade-old recording emerging to feature a candidate making comments that are suddenly relevant to voters today was not lost on Chomsky, who wrote the original story at the time. Oddly enough, that story, headlined Hillary Clinton on Israel, Iraq and Terror, is no longer available on jewishpress.com and even a short summary published on the Free Republic offers a broken link that can no longer surface the story.
I went to my bosses at the time, Chomsky told the Observer. The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybodyeven a direct Quote: from anyonein a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didnt think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.

30990, MSNBC Sources Say Everyone At Network Is Disturbed By Joe Scarborough’s Love Of Donald Trump,"Political pundit Joe Scarborough has a Donald Trump problem, and that makes MSNBC have a Joe Scarborough problem.While other networks, including the ultra-conservatives at Fox News, have been combative with Republican front-runner Trump, MSNBC s Joe Scarborough is cozying up to the unapologetic bigot in a way that has almost everyone at the progressive network extremely worried. It s one thing to have a conservative pundit who can represent  the other side  of the aisle; it s quite another when he s the turning out to be a big fan of a racist, sexist demagogue.CNN s Dylan Byers spoke with numerous sources within MSNBC and found that there is broad agreement that Scarborough is embarrassing both himself and the network with the Trump love.In background discussions, NBC News and MSNBC journalists, reporters and staffers said there was widespread discomfort at the network over Scarborough s friendship with Trump and his increasingly favorable coverage of the candidate. People don t like that Joe is promoting Trump,  one MSNBC insider said. Others described Scarborough s admiration for Trump as  over the top  and  unseemly. Four of those sources also said that the growing media scrutiny over the two men s relationship has caused the network s leadership to more closely monitor Scarborough s comments.  The higher-ups are definitely aware about what s going on,  said another person within MSNBC.  It s an issue. This comes just a few days after Scarborough was very publicly called out for visiting Trump in New Hampshire on the night of the election to celebrate his landslide victory. The next day, Trump went on Morning Joe to personally thank Scarborough and co-host Mika Brzezinski for their  support  for his campaign. It raised more than a few eyebrows.Hilariously, Scarborough seemed to deny both that he went to Trump s hotel room (he did) and that he  supported  Trump (he does). This sharply contrasts with the reality, which is that Scarborough has consistently painted Trump in a positive light.In recent weeks, Scarborough has spoken about Trump in increasingly glowing terms, praising him as  a masterful politician  and defending him against his political opponents and media critics. The Washington Post has noted that Trump has received  a tremendous degree of warmth from the show,  and that his appearances on the show, in person and over the phone, often feel like  a cozy social club. Scarborough also confessed that he coached Trump during his debate prep.Listening to Scarborough talk about Trump and it s obvious there is a lot of admiration there. Trump s blustering stupidity Scarborough mistakes for decisiveness. He may be a small government ideologue, but he likes that Trump wants total control over everything. It s a tyrannical bent that appeals to a guy like Scarborough who views anyone who uses diplomacy or thoughtful, measured responses as  weak. Hey Iran, you have exactly 300 days left to push a US president around. Enjoy it while you can. After that, there will be hell to pay.  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) January 12, 2016This is, of course, a nightmare for MSNBC s reputation. Donald Trump might rev Scarborough s engine, but the Republican candidate has consistently demonstrated that he is a racist, xenophobic, hate-mongering narcissist. He has absolutely no realistic policy plans (building a great wall on the border with Mexico doesn t count) and no political experience.

In each beheading video, he is dressed entirely in black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the bridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm.

Two U.S. government sources told Reuters that John was believed by investigators to be Emwazi, a fluent Arabic speaker from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from the University of Westminster in London with a degree in computer programming.

The British government and police refused to confirm or deny his identity, which was first revealed by the Washington Post, saying it was an ongoing security investigation.

Intelligence services in Britain and the United States were ordered to track down the masked man who became a menacing symbol of the brutality of IS. Authorities used a variety of investigative techniques including voice and facial recognition as well as interviews with former hostages.

Security officials had avoided identifying Emwazi, fearing that to do so would make him more difficult to catch. They were said to be unhappy that the name had been leaked.

Asim Qureshi, the research director of charity Cage which worked with Emwazi since 2009, said that although he could not be certain Emwazi was John, there were some ""striking similarities.""

Cage, which campaigns for those detained on terrorism charges, said Emwazi had got in touch with Cage saying he had been harassed by British security services after trying to take a trip back to Kuwait in 2010 where he was going to get married and had a job waiting.

He was deported to Amsterdam and interrogated by Britain's MI5 domestic security agency and a Dutch intelligence officer who said he was suspected of planning to travel to Somalia, and then sent back to Britain.

Cage said MI5 had tried to recruit him as an informant and a year later blocked his attempts to return to Kuwait where he had begun working for a computer programming company and planned to marry.

The charity, which also worked with Michael Adebolajo, the Muslim covert who with an accomplice killed a British soldier in London in May 2013, said both men had been victims of undue pressure from the security services.

""We now have evidence that there are several young Britons whose lives were not only ruined by security agencies, but who became disenfranchised and turned to violence because of British counter-terrorism policies,"" Qureshi said in a statement.",0

26940,U.S. slated to sell $375 million of emergency reserve oil this winter,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government is slated to sell $375 million worth of crude oil from the country’s emergency reserve this winter after Congress passed a temporary spending bill on Friday that contained a measure authorizing the sale. President Barack Obama’s administration has pushed Congress to approve an up to $2 billion plan for a revamp of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a string of heavily guarded underground salt caverns along the Gulf of Mexico filled with crude. The stash currently holds about 695 million barrels of oil. A Department of Energy spokeswoman said authorization in the spending bill “will allow the Department to take necessary steps to increase the integrity and extend the life” of the reserve.  Congress passed the original funding for the reserve after the 1973 to 1974 Arab oil embargo to protect the country from global supply disruptions that have the potential to spike domestic fuel prices and damage the U.S. economy.  Many of the reserve’s steel tanks and pumps are now rusting after decades of being whipped by storms and exposed to salt air. A plan submitted to Congress by the Energy Department in September said “this equipment today is near, at, or beyond the end of its design life.” In addition, the U.S. oil boom of the last decade has reversed the direction of many pipelines away from the reserve, making it more difficult to get oil to market in a hurry.  The $375 million sale, or nearly 7.3 million barrels of oil in today’s price, is just the first planned installment. For each of the next three fiscal years Congress would have to approve the annual sales to reach the up to $2 billion revamp plan. It remains to be seen whether President-elect Donald Trump would urge Congress for the annual authorizations in the coming years. This sale, which could take place seven to nine weeks after the temporary spending bill is enacted, would pay for the design of the revamp of the SPR and other pre-construction costs.  Further sales would pay for construction of new equipment and new marine terminals to allow the reserve greater capacity to ship oil by vessels. ",0

Big Mistake: Priceless Space Artifact Was Sold at US Government Auction An Essex resident was given the gold coin by a grandfather when he was a child, as part of a collection of “treasure” from around the world that he could play pirate with. “My granddad had travelled all over the world during his working life and had collected many coins from the various countries he had been,” the anonymous owner told the Telegraph . “He gave me bags of coins to play with throughout my early years because I was into pirate treasure.” 
As time went on, the coins ended up packed away, until his grandfather’s passing, when the man rediscovered them. He then passed the coins on to his own son to play pirate. 
“I looked back through the coins – remembering the stories I made up about them when I was small — and then gave them to my own son to play with and put into his own treasure box. My little boy has been playing with this coin as I did all those years ago.” 
Curious to see if it was worth anything, the man took it to experts to see if it had any value. It turns out that the coin was one of fewer than 15 in existence. 
The coin was made from treasure seized from Spanish ships in Vigo Bay, Spain, in 1702, which was later pressed into coins and delivered to Sir Isaac Newton at the Royal Mint. 
The Queen Anne 'Vigo' five-guinea gold coin is set to go to auction at Essex auctioneers Boningtons in November. ...",1

Global equity markets surged on Monday, as did the U.S. dollar, putting them on track for their biggest gains in weeks after the FBI stood by its view that no criminal charges were warranted against Hillary Clinton. The news lifted a cloud over the Democrat's presidential campaign and gave it new momentum just two days before the U.S. election It also sent the benchmark S&P 500 index up more than 1 percent. The index was on pace to snap a nine-day losing skid, its longest in more than 35 years, and to post its best daily performance in over four months. European stocks were up 1.4 percent and many of the safe-haven assets that had performed so strongly last week when polls showed Republican candidate Donald Trump closing the gap reversed course as gold and bonds fell. 
Investors had been unnerved in recent days by signs of a tightening presidential race, preferring what is seen as a known quantity in Clinton, over the politcal wild card, Trump.",1

The newest unsealed documents are explosive enough with the revelation that there was a payoff to three reporters to push negative news on Trump. Who are the three journalists? Well, Fusion GPS wants that to remain a secret Unsealed court documents reveal that the firm behind the salacious 34-page Trump-Russia Dossier, Fusion GPS, was paid $523,000 by a Russian businessman convicted of tax fraud and money laundering, whose lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was a key figure in the infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower arranged by Fusion GPS associate Rob Goldstone.In short, D.C. opposition research firm Fusion GPS is the common denominator linked to two schemes used to damage the Trump campaign.PAYOFF TO THREE JOURNALISTS:Newly filed court documents confirm that Fusion GPS, the company mostly responsible for the controversial  Trump dossier  on presidential candidate Donald Trump, made payments to three journalists between June 2016 until February 2017.The revelation could be a breakthrough for House Republicans, who are exploring whether Fusion GPS used the dossier, which was later criticized for having inaccurate information on Trump, to feed anti-Trump stories to the press during and after the presidential campaign. The three journalists who were paid by Fusion GPS are known to have reported on  Russia issues relevant to [the committee s] investigation,  the House Intelligence Committee said in a court filing.REDACTED DOCUMENTS AND RESTRAINING ORDERS:But the recipients  names, the amounts, and purposes of those payments were either redacted from the documents that Fusion GPS filed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or were not disclosed.Fusion has asked the court to issue a restraining order against the House committee, which is demanding documents from the company that, among other things, explain the payments it made to reporters. Most of the documents sought are banking records.Let s hope that the details come to light and all are held accountable for their corruption.",1
