38854,"Trump, Clinton court Ohio as White House race enters final 2 months","CANFIELD, Ohio/CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton opened a final two-month sprint to the Nov. 8 election on Monday with the Republican presidential nominee suddenly looking stronger as he and his Democratic rival took their bitter fight to Ohio. Both Trump and Clinton made overtures to a news media that each candidate sees as often hostile to them, talking to reporters on their private planes. Clinton’s session with reporters was her first news conference since last December. After eating a gyro at a diner in the Cleveland area, Trump rallied thousands of cheering supporters at a county fair in Canfield, and Clinton visited a brewery in Cleveland. For a time, their planes were parked about 200 yards apart at the Cleveland airport, a sign of Ohio’s importance in the election. Ohio is considered one of four swing states - those that are not clearly in the Democratic or Republican camp - that could prove decisive in the Electoral College vote that will ultimately determine the winner. The other swing states are Florida, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Trump was buoyed by more polls showing him in a competitive position. The latest Reuters-Ipsos poll showed Trump with 40 percent support vs 39 percent for Clinton, effectively ending Clinton’s bump up in the polls after the Democratic nominating convention. Other polls showed Clinton’s lead had shrunk. “I think we’ve had a great month,” Trump said. Clinton remained in a strong position to win the White House race, but Trump and his team cited his growing strength in opinion polls nationally and in several states where the election is likely to be decided to argue that his message is breaking through to voters. Clinton, who emerged into the public eye after days of raising money from wealthy donors behind closed doors, said she always knew the race would be close. “We’re just going as hard and fast as we possibly can to be organized for turning out the vote, because we’ve always thought this was going to be hard, and that’s why, you know, I’m not worried, I’m just working,” she said. Trump, shaking his fist triumphantly, plunged into a crowd at the Mahoning County Fair where supporters had built a replica of the wall that the Republican nominee has pledged to build along the U.S.-Mexico border.  “This has been an unbelievable reception!” Trump said after maneuvering through a crowd of people who shouted his name, against a backdrop of food stands offering fare ranging from chicken on a stick to Italian sausages, fudge and fresh corn. Inviting reporters onto his plane for the first time since accepting the Republican presidential nomination, Trump said his focus going forward will be on how to create jobs for middle-class Americans. He has spent most of the past two weeks trying to clarify his position on illegal immigration, first flirting with a softening, then reinforcing his hardline approach, and then, on his plane, saying undocumented people might ultimately get on a path to a legal status once border enforcement steps are taken. “I’m all about the jobs now,” he said, saying his position on the immigration issue was now well known. He also pledged to participate in all three televised presidential debates, ending speculation that he might sit out one or more if he was not happy with the format. His first face-off with Clinton is at Hofstra University in New York state on Sept. 26. Clinton made her stop at a brewery in Cleveland before heading to a nearby Labor Day parade and rally, where she tested a new jab at her opponent: “Friends don’t let friends vote for Trump.”  The Labor Day holiday traditionally kicks off the last stretch of campaigning ahead of the November election. Speaking to reporters on her new campaign plane, she took credit for Trump’s overture to the news media. Clinton, buffeted by controversy over her use of a private email server as U.S. secretary of state, has been criticized by Republicans and the news media for months for failing to hold a news conference. “I heard now that we’ve got this great plane, that Donald Trump actually invited his press on his plane where I’m told he even answered a few questions,” said Clinton. Trump’s rebound from a series of self-inflicted wounds follows the hiring of a new campaign management team, and the Republican nominee is showing more discipline on the stump. Trump has been helped by what his campaign said was a positive week last week, highlighted by a quick trip to Mexico, appearing side by side with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, and a visit to a black church in Detroit. But an immigration speech that Trump gave following his trip to Mexico drew criticism from some of his Hispanic supporters, and several backers advising him on the issue decided to part ways with his campaign. Trump aide Jason Miller said rising poll numbers showed that the campaign was moving in the right direction. “The trend lines are the important thing to point to,” Miller told Reuters. “The problem that Clinton has is there is no positive information flow for her campaign.” Clinton, who was President Barack Obama’s first-term secretary of state, appeared at few public campaign events during the latter half of August, instead raising funds at high-dollar events in the East Coast vacation spots of Martha’s Vineyard and the Hamptons, and with celebrities in Los Angeles and high-tech leaders in Silicon Valley. Clinton’s campaign announced that it had raised $143 million in August for her presidential bid and the Democratic Party. Clinton is again on the defensive over her use of a private email server and possible conflicts of interest with her family foundation while secretary of state, which have caused unease for some voters. But experts still see the Democratic nominee as the odds-on favorite to win the presidency. ",0
24186,Republican lawmakers to join Obama's Cuba visit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A small group of Republican lawmakers will join President Barack Obama’s historic trip to Cuba on Sunday, underlining growing divisions in the party over the future of the United States’ trade embargo against the island nation. At least five Republicans, all known for favoring normal trade relations with Cuba, will make the trip, congressional sources and lawmakers told Reuters.  Republican congressional leaders have made opposition to President Barack Obama’s easing of the Cuban trade embargo a hallmark of their foreign policy. But an increasing number of party members, drawn by the economic benefits of scrapping the cold war-era embargo, are lining up to back the White House. “This is the right policy. He’s done the right thing,” said Republican Senator Jeff Flake, an outspoken proponent of closer ties with Cuba who is going to Havana. Besides Flake, Republicans making the trip include House of Representatives members Mark Sanford, Tom Emmer and Reid Ribble, as well as Senator Dean Heller, congressional sources and lawmakers said. All of the representatives confirmed their participation, except for Heller, whose office declined requests for comment. But other lawmakers confirmed his travel. Republicans backing Obama’s policy cut against the grain of the party’s establishment thinking that seeks to avoid giving Obama any kind of policy win, either domestically or internationally. Normalizing relations with Cuba would be a significant foreign policy legacy for Obama. Many Republicans see the embargo as contrary to their party’s pro-business tenets and believe the government should not tell citizens where they can travel. “It’s about Americans’ freedom and embracing engagement rather than isolation as a way of changing other governments,” Sanford said in a Facebook post explaining his decision to make the trip. At least 15 of the 54 Republicans in the Senate, mostly members from states like Kansas where agriculture is a significant industry, have publicly backed increased Cuban trade or fewer restrictions on travel. Supporters of Obama’s policy say the total number of Republican supporters in the House and Senate reaches several dozen. Some members say they want to see how the election plays out before speaking publicly. The U.S. embargo on Cuba, first imposed in 1960, can be lifted only via a majority vote in Congress, which is now controlled by Republicans. Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro shocked the world in December 2014 by abruptly announcing the Cold War adversaries would move to normalize relations after more than a half-century’s estrangement. The news drew immediate condemnation in Congress, where a bloc of mostly Republican Cuban-American lawmakers has worked to keep tight restrictions on trade and travel with Cuba for years. Although polls show 72 percent of Americans want to abandon the embargo, the Republican party line has firmly supported the restrictions. Critics of Obama’s policy say Cuba’s government is still too repressive for the United States to ease restrictions.  But this week businessman Donald Trump, who has questioned the embargo, easily won the Republican primary in Florida, defeating leading embargo advocate Senator Marco Rubio. Trump’s victory countered the long-standing assumption that the state’s Cuban exiles would defeat any anti-embargo candidate. A young generation of Cuban-Americans has warmed to Obama’s engagement policy, with many excited about the chance to open businesses in their homeland. Ribble, a founder of the House Cuba Working Group who is going on the trip, represents Wisconsin, one of several states where farmers want the chance to sell to an island just 90 miles from the U.S. coast. “American producers are missing out on a market that imports the vast majority of its agricultural products, and Cubans are missing out on exposure to the freedom and democracy that lies just 90 miles from their shore,” Ribble said in a statement. (This story corrects name to Dean Heller not Mark in paragraph 5.) ",0
36096,"You Say ‘Anguria,’ I Say ‘Cocomero’: Italy’s Many Dialects - The New York Times","Say you’re shopping at a farmer’s market in Rome, and you’d like to pick up some nice, ripe watermelon. The signs at some stands call it “anguria” others say “cocomero” or “melone d’acqua. ” Why so many different words for the same fruit? Because in their daily lives, many Italians don’t speak Italian. That is, they don’t shop or chat or argue in standard Italian, the kind that is studied in school and heard on the news. They use one of the country’s hundreds of local dialects, each with its own quirks of pronunciation, inflection and vocabulary. “You call it watermelon in New York, and that would be ‘anguria’ in Italian,” said Tino Mattiussi, a   owner of a fruit and vegetable stand in the colorful Campo de’ Fiori market in central Rome. “But here, everyone knows it as ‘cocomero,’ so I wrote what people understand better. ” A few stands away, Mauro Ranucci had a different approach. “We advertise it as ‘anguria,’ as that is Italian,” he said firmly. “At least, that’s how people call it in the north. ” When a southerner once asked him for a “melone d’acqua,” Mr. Ranucci said, it took him a minute to realize what he meant. “We all speak Italian with strong regional connotations, even if the discrepancies are minor,” said Giovanni Ronco, vice director of the Italian Linguistic Atlas. “No other country has so many linguistic differences in such a limited space. ” For centuries, Italy was a fragmented patchwork of thousands of small, insular communities. When the country unified in 1861, 90 percent of the population was illiterate and spoke only the local tongue. They are called Italian dialects, Mr. Ronco said, but many of these tongues are really separate languages, descended directly from Latin. That helps account for the many names for familiar things, even within a single region. An anchovy is an “alice” in some parts of southern Italy, for example, but an “acciuga” in others. Neighboring dialects may be similar, but people from opposite ends of Italy  —   say, Sicily and Lombardy  —   might struggle to understand what the other said. Only in the 1950s, when televisions began to appear in bars and homes, did many ordinary Italians around the country start to hear the same standard language being spoken it’s based on the Florentine dialect, which was used in the former royal courts and in many great works of literature. Now, most people know standard Italian as well as their local dialect  —   which sometimes necessitates thinking twice about what to call a fruit. “It’s not a big problem, after all,” Mr. Ranucci said as he offered a customer a yellow and dark red peach. “If we don’t understand each other, we just gesticulate. ”",0
27594, SCOTUS Ruling On Texas’ Abortion Law Was Based In Actual Science That Texas GOP Wanted Buried,"The GOP s anti-science stance is helping them do nothing but spiral ever farther out into the stratosphere, while people who actually understand and trust science are still firmly grounded. The Supreme Court struck down Texas  restrictive abortion law, but they didn t make that ruling without taking a lot of facts into account. Many of those facts were science   something the GOP absolutely abhors.The ruling attacked Texas lawmakers for their sorry lack of those facts. The dissent from Justices Clarence Thomas, John Roberts and Samuel Alito seemed to focus more on defining the word  right,  and the definition of  undue burden  than it did on whether the law actually had a negative effect on Texas women.Thomas even went so far as to say: Moreover, by second-guessing medical evidence and making its own assessments of  quality of care  issues, the majority reappoints this Court as  the country s ex officio medical board with powers to disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States.' That isn t what happened. There s this thing called  expert witnesses,  and they testified on this case. Expert witnesses exist because judges can t be expected to know everything about everything. Breyer s opinion cited data, along with expert testimony, as the reason for why the court voted to strike the law down.As for where some of those experts came from? A team of researchers from the University of Texas has been looking hard at the effects of that law since it went into effect in 2013. They studied everything from abortion access in rural areas to Twitter traffic, and they found that the law did, indeed, restrict access to abortion. That just makes women decide to try and end their pregnancies themselves, and all this research points to that actually happening in Texas.The Texas GOP didn t like that at all. One of the reasons the GOP is so anti-science is because science often contradicts their policies, making them look like the dogmatic morons they are. Texas even went so far as to pressure their head of health research to resign because of this: Texas Republicans often said the researchers  math didn t check out. When one unflattering study in February suggested that funding cuts to Planned Parenthood restricted access to women s health care, the state s head of health research resigned under pressure from GOP lawmakers, who questioned his contributions to a  deeply flawed and highly political report.' To fire a state official for cooperating with scientific research that leads away from what you think, you re working to bury the research. That s what this was.When conservatives say,  I m not a scientist, and neither are you,  they re really just dodging the issue entirely. Sometimes, they re even shirking responsibility for the effects of, oh, say, a bad law like this one.  I m not a scientist, and neither are you,  is nothing more than cowardice.The sheer volume of research that came out of Texas doesn t exist in other states, and pro-choice groups have been jumping on this for obvious reasons. But conservatives are increasingly anti-science and anti-education. They wouldn t have tried to bury this if that weren t true.Featured image by Pete Marovich/Getty Images",1
23201," Conservatives Get Out Measuring Tape, Find Obama’s New House Is Sort Of Near Islamic Center","The conservative media, quite literally having nothing better to do, decided rock bottom wasn t deep enough and dug a little deeper. What they found was that President Obama will be moving to a house that s vaguely near an Islamic Center. Surely this changes everything!With Obama s time in office coming to a close, the family announced that they would be staying in Washington D.C. after they left the White House so that Sasha and Malia could finish school there. The house they chose is one befitting a former president and was once owned by a senior adviser to Bill Clinton.The move will put the Obamas in one of Washington s wealthiest ZIP codes, in a secluded precinct backing up to Rock Creek Park that is home to diplomats and a focal point of the capital s cocktail-party circuit. The home itself is luxurious; photographs posted by Washington Fine Properties, which listed it when it sold in 2014, show spacious rooms with hardwood floors, white marble countertops, his-and-her master bathrooms and a terrace with formal gardens.Conservatives, naturally, promptly lost their minds. The Obamas, they reasoned, should not be allowed to live in a nice house. I ll leave the reasons why this particular First Family can t live in a nice house or, say, eat in a fancy restaurant up to your imagination.But the crack team of conservative airheads over at Tucker Carlson s The Daily Caller took another approach: A quick Google Maps search found that the Obamas  new home is  wait for it  sort of near an Islamic Center.Here s how the Daily Caller s Eric Owens framed it:The mammoth, multi-million-dollar mansion where President Barack Obama and his family will reportedly live after the first family exits the White House is located 1,096 feet from the Islamic Center of Washington   one of the largest mosques in the Western Hemisphere.What follows is hundreds of words devoted to painfully describing every detail about the Islamic Center and its function. (Hint: Muslims do Islam in there, if you can believe it.) Hilariously, Owens also notes that the embassy of Oman and the  former  embassy of Iran are  close to Obama s new mansion.  This presumably means something.It s hard to fathom that we are approaching President Obama s final months in office and the right-wing movement has yet to let the  Obama is a secret Muslim  conspiracy go. A quick scroll through The Daily Caller s comment section cesspool finds that a strong majority of readers truly believe this to be the case.If you re curious as to why places like The Daily Caller are obsessing over Obama s proximity to Islamic Centers and the number of bathrooms in his new house, it just might have to do with the fact that President Obama is riding a wave of popularity. Having used his second term to nail one legacy affirming accomplishment after another, Obama currently enjoys a favorability rating that is higher than Reagan s and a strong wind at his back as he closes out a presidency that people like Tucker Carlson and Eric Owens insisted would be a country-destroying disaster.But let s ignore all that because a thousand feet away from Obama s new house is an Islamic Center. Good grief.Featured image via The Wire",1
43408,Sanders says he will meet with Hillary Clinton on Tuesday,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said he will meet with his rival Hillary Clinton on Tuesday to press her to embrace his progressive agenda, saying he wants to know what she will stand for if she becomes president. Speaking on ABC’s “This Week” program on Sunday, Sanders did not concede he had lost the Democratic presidential nomination to Clinton, who is leading in Democratic primaries and is the party’s presumed nominee.  Sanders said he and Clinton would discuss “if she wins, what kind of administration she will have.” “What I need to see (is) a commitment that there will be progressive taxation,” he said, saying corporations and billionaires should pay higher tax rates. He repeated his stance that he would do “everything I can” to ensure Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, will not become president. Sanders said he wanted to see Clinton embrace his view that healthcare should be a universal right in America and public universities should offer education for free. “Will she go as far as I would like her to go?  No, she won’t,” he said. “But I think millions of people want to understand and see is what kind of commitment she has to addressing the real crises in the country.” ",0
24261,Finding a Home in the Bronx After Fleeing Anti-Gay Violence in Haiti - The New York Times,"The party was like many others in Delmas, a neighborhood in the Haitian capital,    with a vibrant gay community  —   an evening of men in colorful dresses and revealing attire, laughing and catching up. They sipped Prestige beer and   as Beyoncé and Rihanna played in the background. The party stretched into the early morning hours with no end in sight. Then someone knocked on the door. On that March night in 2012, a group of men dressed in black and wearing ski masks forced their way into the apartment. Wilkenson Joseph, then 35, was the closest to the front door. Wearing a red sequin dress, a dark wig, red lipstick and high heels, he was a prime target for the group looking to attack gay men. One of the men stabbed Mr. Joseph in the gut with a knife. His friends picked him up off the floor, blood pouring from his mouth and his side, and rushed him to a hospital. But a doctor demanded $2, 000 before he would provide any care, Mr. Joseph said. For an hour and a half, his friends negotiated a lower rate as he continued to bleed, eventually persuading the doctor to accept $1, 000. Mr. Joseph survived, but he lost his appendix. In a Manhattan office last month, Mr. Joseph recalled his stories of   violence slowly, softly and in French. “After the party,” Mr. Joseph said before trailing off, his eyes closing. There was silence as he summoned the months after that party more than four years ago. He stopped attending parties and dressing up. “It was too traumatic,” he said. “I recoiled from the party scene. I was no longer me. ” Mr. Joseph said it was not the first time he had been attacked because of his sexuality in Haiti, where homosexuality is not a crime, but gay men often hide their orientation to avoid being targeted. A makeup artist for eight years, he had worked at “Journal de Loisirs,” a celebrity talk show, and often carried a purse and makeup bag to the office. Seven months before the stabbing, Mr. Joseph said, he was kidnapped from his workplace, hooded and taken to an abandoned home, where he was chained to a pole and beaten. Three men threatened to kill him, he said, and called him an embarrassment to his country. They later let him go. “I always felt threatened,” he said. “And I never said anything back to these people. I was afraid of a violent response. There was always a fear. ” After the 2012 attack, Mr. Joseph applied for a tourist visa to the United States, hoping the country would be as welcoming as it was portrayed on the television shows he had watched as a child, he said. “It was always my dream country,” Mr. Joseph said. “America is where you can make happen the dreams you envision for yourself. ” He arrived in April 2013 on a tourist visa and settled in New York City. A few weeks later, he attended his first party since the attack, at the Monster, a piano bar in the West Village. Feeling safe, he took the stage to sing “Lumane Casimir,” a   Haitian song. He applied for asylum shortly after moving to the United States, describing in his application the   abuse he endured in Haiti and his fear of returning there. “I feel a lot more comfortable expressing myself here,” he said. “I’ve never feared for my safety here. ” Since his visa expired, he has been working on his immigration status for the past two years with lawyers at Cadwalader, Wickersham  Taft, a law firm in Manhattan. He has applied for asylum and has not received an update. They are awaiting an interview date with immigration services. Mr. Joseph lives on $376 monthly in public assistance, including cash assistance and Medicaid. Through a designation known as PRUCOL, he is able to receive benefits despite not having legal status. Without a job, he has struggled to afford a home, flitting between Florida, New Jersey and New York. Shortly after coming to New York, he found himself on the streets, spending nights riding the subway and shuffling between shelters, always worrying that his visa and passport would be stolen. He found temporary housing in Jamaica, Queens, through Unique People Services, an   supportive housing program. He stayed there for more than a year, but the conditions were dangerous, Mr. Joseph said. Drug activity brought the police often. Once, he said, a neighbor robbed him of $150. Mr. Joseph has found support in Voix Fortes, a   group focused on  . There he met Houda Chergui, a coordinator at the nonprofit ASCNYC, which assists New Yorkers living with and at risk for  . She recommended he seek help through the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times’s Neediest Cases Fund. With the help of ASCNYC and the African Services Committee, he was able to move into permanent housing, an apartment in the Bronx, in March the city’s   Services Administration covers his monthly rent of $1, 100. But the apartment was bare. He slept on the floor and had nowhere to sit or eat. In April the federation provided Mr. Joseph with a $1, 000 grant from the Neediest Cases Fund to buy furniture. He decorated his apartment with a sofa bed, a chair and a coffee table. “The furniture made it into a home,” he said. Mr. Joseph, who had dropped out of school in Haiti to support his family after his father’s death, longs to continue his education and get a job as a masseur or as a counselor to help others, while sending some money to his relatives in Haiti. “I want to continue my studies,” he said. “I want to be able to motivate other people in my situation  —   others in the L. G. B. T. Q. community  —   to pursue their education. Before respect comes from others, it comes from within. ”",0
13196, Rand Paul’s Solution For Healthcare Is Only Half Horrible (VIDEO),"Rand Paul is a self-described libertarian, but his idea for how to fix our healthcare system sounds awfully socialist. On the right, Paul has been one of the biggest critics of Trumpcare, calling it  Obamacare lite. What we think is being hidden from conservatives is there s a lot of  Obamacare Lite  in their bill,  the Kentucky Republican said on CNN s  New Day  Friday.  There s a new entitlement program.   There is also a Cadillac tax or something similar to the Cadillac tax that was in Obamacare. And there s also an individual mandate, believe it or not. Instead of paying the mandate to the government, they re going to tell you you have to pay the mandate, by law, to an insurance company. Paul, speaking at a Freedom Works rally, had his own proposal, which might as well have been an advertisement for the National Rifle Association. His suggestion is that people should be able to buy health insurance through the NRA.Here s the video: You see what he did there?The truth is, this isn t the worst idea in the world. The NRA is a sizable membership organization, but it s far from the biggest. The fact is, large groups people have a lot more clout than individuals. AAA has 40 million members, as compared to the NRA s 4.5. The AARP would probably be happy to negotiate with insurance companies and sell policies to their members.Inadvertently, though, the rabidly anti-union (but pro-gun) Republican, made the case for unions. Individuals don t have much if any negotiating power with insurance companies, or really, anyone. Still, Republicans want to leave individuals on their own, with the imagined idea that somehow, shopping is equivalent to negotiating. It s not. If you have the option to buy from six overpriced plans, you re still paying too much, but hey, you got a choice.The third largest membership organization in the world is a union. Unfortunately, you have to work for them to get the benefits of their negotiations, but if more people had access to unions, prices would drop across the board.But, there is one major problem with Paul s idea. Most employers, including most union employers, pick up at least part of the monthly tab. That s where the government subsidies that Republicans hate would come in. If an organization like AAA or even the NRA were to offer health insurance, it would still cost a lot more money than a decent employer plan, at least without some government help.Sorry, Republicans, but unions aren t synonymous with corruption anymore than the corporations that supply the paychecks, but they do give workers a voice, and in the case of goods and services, they give workers negotiating power. All free market Republicans should be behind more negotiating power, but the truth is, Republicans only want the market to be free for large corporations. All the rest of us should be at their mercy.Still, even at half bad, it s better than Trumpcare.Featured image via video screen capture",1
71912,Rappoport: ‘CNN Already Deflecting From the Susan Rice Scandal’,"By Jon RappoportCNN is already claiming the whole Susan Rice scandal is a tempest in a teapot, and the Trump team is exaggerating it to distract the public from  something. Fill in the blank yourself.For example: Trump isn t actually the president, he cheated his way into the Oval Office, while acting as a secret agent for his handler, Vladimir Putin, who in turn was operating on behalf of aliens from Jupiter.The Susan Rice scandal is out in the open. She, Obama s national security advisor, led an effort to spy on legal phone calls the Trump team was making during the presidential campaign, in order to gain  intelligence on the enemy. The Daily Caller News Foundation (DCNF) spoke with  Col. (Ret.) James Waurishuk, an NSC [National Security Council] veteran and former deputy director for intelligence at the U.S. Central Command.  Waurishuk said:   many hands had to be involved throughout the Obama administration to launch such a political spying program  It s unbelievable of [sic] the level and degree of the [Obama] administration to look for information on Donald Trump and his associates, his campaign team and his transition team. This is really, really serious stuff . Michael Doran, former NSC [National Security Council] senior director, told The DCNF Monday that  somebody blew a hole in the wall between national security secrets and partisan politics . This  was a stream of information that was supposed to be hermetically sealed from politics and the Obama administration found a way to blow a hole in that wall , he said. Yes, serious stuff. A felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.Obama, of course, will have plausible deniability if the Susan Rice scandal blows up into a Watergate. He didn t know. He didn t order the spying. He was playing golf that day. Or any day.And if a Congressional investigation of Rice and her antics reaches a fever pitch, somebody can play the race card. That s always an option. If Rice were white, this never would have happened to her. The Trump people are all over her like white on Rice. Meanwhile, CNN, in alternating segments, can say a) Rice and her people never spied on anybody, and b) everybody spies on everybody all the time, it s not a big deal and then some on-air goofball will add,  In fact, we here at CNN are spying  And the TV screen will go blank, then display colored stripes, then come back and the goofball will be gone, and an anchor will say,  We had a technical problem for a moment.

52103," WATCH: Hillary CRUSHES Trump On Kimmel, Will Draw On Elementary School Experience To Debate Him","Hillary Clinton appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday night and absolutely killed it.Jimmy Kimmel has spent a lot of time on his show mocking Donald Trump, so it was only natural for him to talk to the Democratic nominee about him.The first segment of the interview was dedicated entirely to discussing the imploding Republican nominee.Right after Hillary sat down Kimmel remarked that the crowd was cheering quite enthusiastically for the  co-founder of ISIS,  which drew laughter from the former Secretary of State, who replied that the claim was one of the crazier things that Trump has said during his campaign.And with all the ridiculous things Trump has said on the campaign trail, Kimmel asked if she gets upset. I don t get upset anymore,  Clinton said,  because I d be upset all the time. Hillary pointed out that Trump s rhetoric is music to the terrorists  ears because they would love to influence our elections in any way they can. It also gives them advertising material to use to draw new recruits.Considering Trump s unpredictability and insanity throughout his run for the presidency, Kimmel wondered how Hillary is preparing to debate him, which drew a very interesting and hilarious response. I watched a lot of his debates during the primaries and he insulted all of his opponents, he insulted all the moderators, he insulted, I guess about 80 percent of the American people and the rest of the world  You gotta be prepared for all the wacky stuff that comes at you. I am drawing on my experience in elementary school. Kimmel also asked Hillary about her health and the claims of Trump and his team that she is unfit to serve because she is not well. Hillary compared Trump s attack to a tabloid story, remarking that the National Enquirer once said she would be dead in six months, but that was a long time ago and she s still full of life. I don t know why they are saying this,  Clinton said.  I think on the one hand, it s part of the wacky strategy. Just say all these crazy things and maybe you can get some people to believe you. On the other hand, it just absolutely makes no sense. I don t go around questioning Donald Trump s health. Kimmel then challenged her to open a pickle jar to prove her fitness, and she opened it.Hillary then admitted that she had hoped to be running against someone more serious and qualified to do the job of President of the United States. I would prefer to be running against somebody who I thought was qualified to be president and temperamentally fit to be commander-in-chief I don t think we ve ever been confronted with somebody who we see right now in the midst of this election is unqualified and temperamentally unfit. Hillary went on to name three Republicans who have endorsed her and praised their decision to put country first.And at the end of the interview, she read some mean quotes uttered by Donald Trump. But she refused to read the one of Trump saying he would date his own daughter.This was an excellent interview for Hillary Clinton. She dispelled the rampant falsehoods being pushed by Trump and his minions while at the same time showing the American people that she is a positive person who is qualified for the office she seeks. Now it s just a matter of waiting for the thin-skinned Trump to throw a hissy fit about on Twitter.Featured image via Screenshot",1
61298,"Hillary Melts Down Over Weiner In Public, PICS Prove Campaign Is Imploding","Hillary Melts Down Over Weiner In Public, PICS Prove Campaign Is Imploding Posted on October 30, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics Share This 
Hillary Clinton’s campaign is imploding, and it’s so bad that she was caught having a mini meltdown after her press conference as she tried to explain this new email investigation by the FBI, thanks to Anthony Weiner’s laptop. As Hillary lost it, her campaign was caught red-handed, doing dirty tricks to pictures, and you’ll love just how desperate they have become as they see this election sinking like the Titanic. 
Rumors are flying after Hillary Clinton responded to the latest bomb dropped on her campaign, that thousands of government emails are on Anthony Weiner’s laptop. Everyone knows Hillary should have been indicted before, and she had a meltdown of sorts when Kristen Welker of Fox News asked, “Are you worried this could sink your campaign, Secretary Clinton?” 
While Hillary was walking away from the short press conference after the Weiner email story broke, she stopped and threw her head back and let out a creepy maniacal laugh . Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin found it really weird, saying it was like Hillary had lost it. She described Hillary “stopping and throwing her head back and laughing, it was really odd.” ""Are you worried this could sink your campaign, Secretary Clinton,"" a reporter shouts as HRC walks out. Clinton only lets out a big laugh. 
— Ruby Cramer (@rubycramer) October 28, 2016 
However, Hillary Clinton was not really laughing. That was a public meltdown, and she is pissed off that an idiot like Anthony Weiner just cost her this election. It’s so bad that the Clinton campaign was caught photoshopping the crowd at a recent Ohio rally, where Bill Clinton spoke. Bill Clinton rally Oct. 29th, red arrow shows a man (left) who was duplicated in photoshopped pic put out by Clinton campaign, indicated with red circles (right) 
Then, if all of that isn’t bad enough, the Chicago Tribune, one of the most liberal papers in the country, had this headline yesterday: “ Democrats Should Ask Hillary To Step Down ,” which was written by John Kass who was speaking from Hillary’s real home state of Illinois. 
“FBI director James Comey ‘s announcement about the renewed Clinton email investigation is the bombshell in the presidential campaign. That he announced this so close to Election Day should tell every thinking person that what the FBI is looking at is extremely serious .” [via Chicago Tribune ] 
If we are agreeing with the Chicago Tribune, you know what happened on Friday with James Comey and the FBI is so devastating that this election is over for Hillary. However, that doesn’t mean we can let up and sigh with relief just yet. 
However, we can be extremely optimistic that, after eight years and two elections that caused utter destruction for our country, we have an extremely good chance that Americans will reject Hillary and her criminal cabal. America was saved by Anthony Weiner, and it doesn’t get any stranger than that.",1
32293," Former Secretary Of State Drops MASSIVE Shocker On Trump’s Foreign Policy, And He’ll DESPISE It","Madeleine Albright, who served as Secretary of State under Bill Clinton, has something to say about Trump and his immigration and foreign policy positions. Trump, as we all know, is in love with the idea that only he and his policies can protect us from ISIS. However, real international diplomats know that s not true, and Albright said so on a podcast with former Obama strategist David Axelrod.Albright just came right out and said it: If this   anti-immigrant rhetoric and the executive order that came out was supposed to protect us, it has done the opposite. Frankly, it s a great recruiting tool for ISIS. We already know that ISIS has used Trump in recruiting videos, but what Albright says is that Trump is destroying any incentive that Iraqis and other Middle Easterners might have to help us, as opposed to helping ISIS or doing nothing at all. Trump s Muslim ban doesn t just alienate them, it also makes it a lot more difficult to gather intelligence from the region. We need cooperation for intelligence-gathering, but why should they help us when we re openly calling them the enemy via our immigration policies?Albright also said that she believes Trump and his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, are actually hostile to Europe while being overly friendly to Russia. That, too, can serve as recruitment for ISIS and other terrorist groups, if for no other reason than it demonstrates how fickle we are, and how unlikely to keep our promises and back up our allies we are.Trump claimed he could beat ISIS inside of 30 days (although he didn t say which 30-day period he was talking about). If nothing else, he s said that we have to beef up our military strength, and implied that we need to ally with whoever we can (even former enemies) in order to beat them.Albright is right, and Trump is putting us in danger. All his anti-immigrant, nationalist rhetoric does is galvanize everyone who already felt alienated by our foreign policy. That includes Muslims, particularly those living here in the U.S. We are not safer under Trump, and ISIS knows that.Featured image by Aude Guerrucci via Getty Images",1
38434, Obama Announces ‘Unfinished Business’ For 2016 And The Right Will Hate It (VIDEO),"President Obama began the new year of 2016 with a video asking for the nation s help in fighting one of its biggest problems: gun violence.In his weekly presidential address Obama ran through the accomplishments of his administration from 2009 to present, including job creation, expansion of health insurance, lowered oil costs, and marriage equality. Then he spoke about the  unfinished business  of fighting the epidemic of gun violence.Last month, we remembered the third anniversary of Newtown. This Friday, I ll be thinking about my friend Gabby Giffords, five years into her recovery from the shooting in Tucson. And all across America, survivors of gun violence and those who lost a child, a parent, a spouse to gun violence are forced to mark such awful anniversaries every single day.Obama then noted that even though a majority of homes support policies to expand background checks   even homes with NRA members   the Republican congress refuses to move ahead at the behest of the well-financed National Rifle Association.As a result, Obama notes that  tens of thousands of our fellow Americans have been mowed down by gun violence. But even though its his last year in office, the President is not going to stand still on the issue, despite the threat of backlash from the NRA.A few months ago, I directed my team at the White House to look into any new actions I can take to help reduce gun violence. And on Monday, I ll meet with our Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, to discuss our options. Because I get too many letters from parents, and teachers, and kids, to sit around and do nothing. I get letters from responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time these tragedies happen; who share my belief that the Second Amendment guarantees a right to bear arms; and who share my belief we can protect that right while keeping an irresponsible, dangerous few from inflicting harm on a massive scale.Obama doesn t have to do this, he could sit in office for the next 12 months on his laurels and just accept the achievements that he s accomplished. But he clearly wants to do more, and he s going to get it done.Featured image via YouTube",1
17070,California governor signs bill to automatically register people to vote,"Federal laws already allow people across the country the option to register to vote at the DMV. But Oregon and California's laws are pioneering because they do it automatically.

It's hard to overstate how novel this concept is for the US. Throughout much of United States history, governments frequently put up barriers aimed at preventing people from voting, such as property ownership requirements, poll taxes, or literacy tests.

Gradually, many of these barriers have fallen to make it easier for people to register. However, many states, including California, still close off registration weeks to a month before an election — an artificial obstacle that can prevent perfectly qualified people from voting if they simply miss a deadline.

These new proposals remove those obstacles. Oregon's law will register all adult citizens in the DMV's database, while California's law will be implemented more gradually, as people get or renew their licenses or state IDs, or change their addresses. But both make it the government's responsibility to ensure that all eligible voters are registered.

So it's a big deal that governments are now trying to make it easier and easier to vote, rather than more difficult. Matt Yglesias has argued for going even further and enshrining an affirmative right to vote in our Constitution — read his case here.

In both California and Oregon, Republicans opposed these proposals, but generally didn't argue against the principle of easing registration. Instead, the criticisms have fallen along two main lines.

First, critics have argued that since voter registration data is more publicly accessible than DMV information, automatically adding voters to the rolls could pose privacy concerns. However, supporters respond that people can always opt out.

Second, some Republicans have cited concerns about voter fraud — usually about potential registration of unauthorized immigrants. But while California began issuing driver's licenses to unauthorized immigrants this year, these licenses are distinctively marked, and people with them would not be registered to vote automatically. And Oregon requires proof of citizenship for all driver's license applicants.

Meanwhile, national Democrats are increasingly adopting mandatory voter registration as a major cause. In a speech on voting rights this June, Hillary Clinton called on all states to automatically register citizens to vote when they turn 18, unless they choose to opt out. And legislators in 15 other states have introduced bills similar to Oregon's new law — the Brennan Center is tracking them here.",0

38211,"Arriving in Vietnam, Obama Aims to Lure It Away From China - The New York Times","HANOI, Vietnam  —   President Obama arrived in the steamy capital of Vietnam ahead of schedule on Sunday night to begin three days of meetings in hopes of luring yet another Southeast Asian country away from China’s tight embrace. He was greeted on the tarmac by a young woman in a long yellow dress who handed him a bouquet of flowers. Several   Vietnamese officials shook the president’s hand before he climbed into his limousine for a quick trip to his hotel after nearly 24 hours of travel. Quiet clusters of people on the dark streets watched his motorcade pass. Except for the small groups, the streets seemed to have been completely cleared. Since Air Force One had been scheduled to land after midnight, or about three hours later, the official arrival ceremony with high officials in attendance was postponed until Monday morning. Maybe then Mr. Obama will see the kind of emotional outpouring that greeted President Bill Clinton in 2000, when he became the first United States president to visit the country since the Vietnam War. But it is possible that relations between the two countries have reached a stage that the arrival of an American head of state no longer seems so unusual. Mr. Obama will meet with the country’s newly installed prime minister and president on Monday, then get together with the country’s real power  —   Nguyen Phu Trong, the general secretary of the Communist Party. Mr. Obama’s visit is an important step in a complex dance that Vietnam has carried on with China for centuries. Most of Vietnam’s illustrious historical figures made their reputations by battling Chinese invaders. The population here is deeply nationalistic and   sentiment is visceral. The American War, as it is known here, is mostly forgotten, particularly since half of the population is under 30. Vietnam relies on China for trade, investment and even the water that feeds the vast Mekong Delta, so the leadership knows it can poke the dragon only so much. Indeed, Vietnam had mostly sought to appease China since a brief and bloody war between the countries in 1979, and had shrugged off a series of provocations as China sought in recent years to assert its dominance over the South China Sea, which extends the length of Vietnam’s   coast. But in 2014, China placed a giant   drilling rig to explore for oil and gas right off the Vietnamese coast, and Mr. Trong could not even get his telephone calls to Beijing returned. The confrontation touched off angry protests in Vietnam that led to the deaths of two Chinese and the destruction of Taiwanese and South Korean factories. Since then, Vietnam has stepped up its contacts with the United States. Neither the United States nor Vietnam is ready for a formal alliance, but Vietnam may grant American warships access to its ports, and Washington seems certain at least to widen exceptions to its longtime arms embargo and may end it altogether. Human rights remain a barrier to closer ties.   thugs routinely attack dissidents, and recent protests over a toxic spill that killed vast numbers of fish led to beatings and arrests by the police. While the country does have elections  —   polling places were packed Sunday for a parliamentary election  —   candidates must be approved by the Communist Party. Mr. Obama plans to meet with some dissidents and civil society leaders on Tuesday before making a speech. Brad Adams, the Asia director at Human Rights Watch, suggested that the president “should start by calling for the right of all people to stand for election, voice critical views of government, associate with others and freely choose candidates. ” American help in reforming Vietnam’s economy is also high on the agenda for leaders of both countries. While Vietnam has grown robustly  —   the transformation of this city’s airport and skyline over the past two decades is astonishing  —   the country remains saddled with a bloated state sector that dominates telecommunications and other crucial parts of the economy, and reliance on   manufacturing that will be increasingly difficult to sustain as the country prospers. Widespread corruption undermines economic growth government officials with modest salaries can be seen touring the countryside in expensive European automobiles. There are keen hopes here that the   Partnership, a trade agreement with the United States and 10 other countries, will provide a huge boost. The World Bank estimated that Vietnam would gain the most from the agreement, adding 10 percent to its economic growth by 2030 through increased sales from its textiles and apparel industries. Vietnam is the only developing country in the   pact, and it had to make major concessions on issues like allowing independent labor unions and ensuring environmental compliance. “Vietnam has agreed to allow independent unions that can control their own finances, elect their own leaders, conduct strikes, affiliate as they wish, get assistance from outside labor organizations,” the United States trade representative, Michael Froman, said in a briefing. There is some debate about whether the promised changes are transformational or just cosmetic, but the government took a risk in promising to make them and is now dismayed to see that the pact has little chance of passing Congress anytime soon. Still, innovation incubators, technology   and a focus on small and   companies are now all the rage among development agencies and government officials. Mr. Obama intends to address attendees at an entrepreneurship event on Tuesday afternoon in Ho Chi Minh City.",0
6101,U.S. protest group vows to disrupt Trump inaugural festivities,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of an ad hoc group of protesters enraged by Republican Donald Trump’s election as president of the United States vowed on Wednesday to disrupt his inauguration this week by blocking public access to the event. The DisruptJ20 protest group said it will send groups of demonstrators to the dozen entrances to the grassy National Mall where hundreds of thousands of people are expected to gather to watch Trump, who has never before held public office, be sworn in as president on the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Friday. “We believe that it’s our role and the role of any people with conscience to try to disrupt this inauguration and have a massive showing of resistance on that day,” Samantha Miller, a DisruptJ20 organizer, said at a news conference. The U.S. Secret Service and Washington police are expecting some 900,000 people to pack into the area between the Capitol and White House on Friday to view the swearing-in and will have thousands of uniformed officers on site. Trump has angered many on the left with demeaning comments about women, immigrants and Muslims, a vow to repeal the sweeping healthcare reform law known as “Obamacare” and plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. His supporters admire Trump’s experience in business, including as a real estate developer and reality television star, and view him as a brash problem-solver. Miller said DisruptJ20 will be sending groups of about 100 protesters to block each of the dozen security checkpoints for people entering the inaugural festivities. “There will definitely be interactions with law enforcement that day, no doubt,” Miller said. Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department declined to comment on the group’s plans. “We support everyone’s First Amendment right to peaceably protest,” a spokeswoman said in an email, referring to the amendment to the U.S. Constitution that protects the right to free expression. About 3 square miles (nearly 8 square km) of central Washington will be in a security cordon that will include roadblocks, street barricades and about 3,000 extra police, federal officers and 5,000 National Guard troops. The inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue will pass the Trump International Hotel, a rallying point for protesters since the election. A man set himself on fire late on Tuesday outside the hotel, in what he told NBC 4 television was an anti-Trump protest. Police said he was taken to a hospital for treatment and had no details on his condition. ",0
